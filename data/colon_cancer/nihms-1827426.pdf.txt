Abstract

BACKGROUND—The role of adjuvant chemotherapy in stage II colon cancer continues to 

be debated. The presence of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) after surgery predicts very poor 

recurrence-free survival, whereas its absence predicts a low risk of recurrence. The benefit of 

adjuvant chemotherapy for ctDNA-positive patients is not well understood.

METHODS—We conducted a trial to assess whether a ctDNA-guided approach could reduce the 

use of adjuvant chemotherapy without compromising recurrence risk. Patients with stage II colon 

cancer were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to have treatment decisions guided by either ctDNA 

results or standard clinicopathological features. For ctDNA-guided management, a ctDNA-positive 

result at 4 or 7 weeks after surgery prompted oxaliplatin-based or fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy. 

Patients who were ctDNA-negative were not treated. The primary efficacy end point was 

recurrence-free survival at 2 years. A key secondary end point was adjuvant chemotherapy use.

RESULTS—Of the 455 patients who underwent randomization, 302 were assigned to ctDNA-

guided management and 153 to standard management. The median follow-up was 37 months. A 

lower percentage of patients in the ctDNA-guided group than in the standard-management group 

received adjuvant chemotherapy (15% vs. 28%; relative risk, 1.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 

1.25 to 2.65). In the evaluation of 2-year recurrence-free survival, ctDNA-guided management 

was noninferior to standard management (93.5% and 92.4%, respectively; absolute difference, 

1.1 percentage points; 95% CI, −4.1 to 6.2 [noninferiority margin, −8.5 percentage points]). Three-

year recurrence-free survival was 86.4% among ctDNA-positive patients who received adjuvant 

chemotherapy and 92.5% among ctDNA-negative patients who did not.

CONCLUSIONS—A ctDNA-guided approach to the treatment of stage II colon cancer reduced 

adjuvant chemotherapy use without compromising recurrence-free survival. (Supported by the

Zealand Clinical Trials Registry number, ACTRN12615000381583.)

Colorectal cancer remains common worldwide.1 The current standard care for nonmetastatic 

colon cancer is surgery, with histopathological staging informing the use of up to 6 

months of adjuvant chemotherapy. Although the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy has 

been unequivocally established for patients with stage III colon cancer, its usefulness for 

patients with stage II disease continues to be debated.2 Surgery alone can cure more than 

80% of patients with stage II colon cancer, and no clear overall survival benefit has been 

observed in trials of adjuvant therapy.3–5 Therefore, guidelines currently recommend that 

adjuvant chemotherapy be considered for patients who have stage II colon cancer with 

high-risk clinicopathological features, who may be more likely to benefit from adjuvant 

treatment.6–8 However, the current definitions of “high risk” are inadequate, since many 

patients who have cancer with high-risk features do not have disease recurrence, whereas 

some with disease that is deemed low-risk do. Furthermore, the survival benefit conferred 

by adjuvant chemotherapy remains modest (<5%) even when patients with high-risk 

disease are selectively treated, and therefore many patients are exposed to unnecessary 

chemotherapy.4,9,10

More precise prediction of recurrence risk after surgery for stage II colon cancer could 

address this clinical dilemma, limiting treatment to the group of patients who have disease 

with well-defined high-risk features and are most likely to derive a survival benefit. This 

approach would also allow patients who are at low risk for recurrence to be spared the 

physical and financial cost of unnecessary treatment. To date, efforts to refine recurrence 

risk for nonmetastatic colon cancer have focused on examinations of the resected tumor 

with various biomarkers. Although such tissue-based biomarkers have been reported to be 

associated with recurrence risk, the hazard ratios are typically modest, and their clinical 

application is still contentious.11–14

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis is a promising alternative strategy in which 

peripheral blood (a “liquid biopsy”) is directly evaluated for evidence of minimal 

residual disease that could ultimately be the source of a later clinical recurrence. Several 

observational studies involving patients with solid tumors, including those with stage II 

colon cancer, have confirmed a very high risk of recurrence (>80%) when ctDNA is

detected after curative-intent therapy without further adjuvant treatment.15–17 Nevertheless, 

uncertainty remains as to whether adjuvant treatment is beneficial for these ctDNA-positive 

patients who are at high risk for recurrence.

The Circulating Tumour DNA Analysis Informing Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Stage II 

Colon Cancer (DYNAMIC) trial was a randomized trial designed to investigate whether 

a ctDNA-guided approach as compared with a standard approach in stage II colon cancer 

could reduce the use of adjuvant treatment without compromising the risk of recurrence. 

We further examined outcomes among ctDNA-positive patients who received adjuvant 

chemotherapy, to assess the benefit of treating this high-risk group of patients, as well 

as outcomes among ctDNA-negative patients whose disease was managed by surveillance 

alone.

METHODS

PATIENTS

We enrolled patients with resected histologically confirmed stage II (T3 or T4, N0, 

M0)18 colon or rectal adenocarcinoma with negative resection margins. To be eligible 

for enrollment, patients needed to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 

performance-status score of 0 to 2 (scores range from 0 to 5, with higher numbers reflecting 

greater disability) and had to be medically able to receive adjuvant oxaliplatinbased 

or single-agent fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy. Patients with evidence of macroscopic 

metastatic disease on computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis 

performed within 8 weeks before enrollment were excluded. Other exclusion criteria were a 

history of another primary cancer within the previous 3 years, the presence of synchronous 

primary colorectal cancer, or treatment with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Patients were 

enrolled within 3 weeks after surgery, and an adequate specimen from the resected tumor 

needed to be provided for mutation analysis by 4 weeks after surgery.

TRIAL DESIGN AND INTERVENTIONS

This trial was a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial of biomarker-driven 

adjuvant therapy. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to have their disease 

managed according to ctDNA results (ctDNA-guided management) or managed by the 

treating clinician according to standard clinicopathological criteria (standard management). 

Individual patients were assigned to trial groups with the use of block randomization 

stratified according to the participating center location (regional or metropolitan) and tumor 

stage (T3 or T4).

Plasma specimens were obtained for ctDNA analysis from all patients at week 4 and week 7 

after surgery. Patients underwent randomization after confirmation of adequate tumor tissue 

by central pathological review and confirmation of an adequate week 4 blood specimen. 

For patients assigned to ctDNA-guided management, week 4 and week 7 specimens were 

analyzed concurrently, and ctDNA results were made available to the treating clinician 8 to 

10 weeks after surgery. Patients with a positive ctDNA result at either week 4 or week 7 

received adjuvant singleagent fluoropyrimidine or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, with the

treatment regimen chosen at the clinician’s discretion. Patients with negative ctDNA results 

at both week 4 and week 7 were not treated with adjuvant chemotherapy.

In the standard-management group, all treatment decisions were based on conventional 

clinicopathological criteria. Acceptable chemotherapy regimens for patients in either group 

are listed in Table S1 of the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this 

article at NEJM.org. Dose modifications to chemotherapy were made in accordance with 

local standards.

END POINTS AND ASSESSMENTS

The primary efficacy end point was recurrence-free survival at 2 years. The recurrence-free 

survival time was calculated from the date of randomization to the date of confirmation of 

disease recurrence or death from any cause (whichever occurred earlier) or the last date 

at which the patient was known to be free of disease (censoring time). Recurrence was 

defined as local, regional, or distant relapse. A key secondary end point was treatment 

with adjuvant chemotherapy. Other secondary end points included recurrence-free survival 

among ctDNA-positive and ctDNA-negative patients in the ctDNA-guided group, time to 

recurrence, and overall survival. Exploratory end points included the ctDNA clearance 

rate in ctDNA-positive patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, levels of fear of 

recurrence among the patients, and cost-effectiveness. Overall survival data and outcomes 

for exploratory end points are not reported here.

All patients were to be followed for 5 years, with carcinoembryonic antigen measured every 

3 months for 24 months and then every 6 months for 36 months. Contrast-enhanced CT of 

the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed every 6 months for 24 months and then at 

36 months. Because only standard treatments were used in this trial, adverse events were 

not assessed. Dose intensity and dose adjustments for administered chemotherapy were 

recorded.

TRIAL OVERSIGHT

The trial was initiated by investigators based at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of 

Medical Research (WEHI), which was responsible for overseeing the conduct of the 

trial. All tumor and plasma specimens were analyzed by academic collaborators in a 

central research laboratory (Ludwig Center at Johns Hopkins) using Safe-Sequencing 

System tumor-informed personalized ctDNA assays.15,19 Further details are provided in 

the Supplementary Appendix. The protocol, available at NEJM.org, was approved by the 

institutional review board or ethics committee at the WEHI, Johns Hopkins Medicine, 

and each participating site. All the participants provided written informed consent in 

accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. A statistical analysis plan was 

written and made publicly accessible before the database lock, and the final analysis was 

conducted accordingly.20 Trial data were collected and managed with the use of REDCap 

electronic datacapture tools hosted at the WEHI.21,22 The authors vouch for the accuracy 

and completeness of the data and for the adherence of the trial to the protocol. No one who

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

The overall sample size was chosen to ensure a minimum of 30 patients with a ctDNA-

positive result in the ctDNA-guided group and an acceptable noninferiority margin of 8.5 

percentage points for the analysis of 2-year recurrence-free survival, to exclude the largest 

absolute benefit that could be derived from adjuvant oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy for 

patients with stage II disease.3,23 We calculated that a total sample of 450 patients would 

provide 80% power with a type I error of 5% to show noninferiority of ctDNA-guided 

management to standard management, under the assumption of a 2-year recurrence-free 

survival of 84% with standard management and of 85% with ctDNA-guided management 

and allowing for a 10% dropout rate. The trial was powered to detect a noninferiority 

margin of 5 percentage points for the percentage of patients with recurrence within 2 

years in a time-to-event analysis, as well as a 20-percentage-point difference between the 

standard-management group and the ctDNA-guided group in the percentage of patients 

treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, under the assumption that 30% of the patients in the 

standard-management group and 10% of those in the ctDNA-guided group would receive 

treatment.

The primary efficacy end point was assessed in the intention-to-treat population, which 

included all eligible patients who underwent randomization and had both week 4 and week 

7 postsurgical blood specimens. A sensitivity analysis was performed in the per-protocol 

population, which included patients who had undergone 24-month surveillance imaging 

(unless recurrence or death had already occurred) and, for ctDNA-guided management, 

ctDNA-positive patients who received at least 12 weeks of chemotherapy or ctDNA-

negative patients who received no more than 4 weeks of chemotherapy. Noninferiority 

of ctDNA-guided management to standard management was to be accepted if the lower 

bound of the 95% confidence interval around the estimated difference in the 2-year 

recurrence-free survival was above −8.5 percentage points. In addition, recurrence-free 

survival and percentages of patients with recurrence within 1, 2, and 3 years in a time-

to-event analysis were computed from the Kaplan–Meier survival curves along with the 

associated 95% confidence intervals. Hazard ratios and associated 95% confidence intervals 

were also reported after evaluation of the proportional hazards assumption with the use 

of the Schoenfeld residuals test. The between-group difference in the use of adjuvant 

chemotherapy was assessed as percentages of patients in each group and as relative risk. 

No prespecified plan to control for multiplicity of testing was made, and therefore the 95% 

confidence intervals cannot be used to infer effects. This analysis was conducted when the 

last patient reached a minimum follow-up of 2 years. Statistical analyses were performed 

with R software, version 3.6.1 (R Project for Statistical Computing), and SAS software, 

version 9.4 (SAS Institute).

RESULTS

PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS AND FOLLOW-UP

A total of 459 patients were enrolled from 23 Australian centers between August 10, 2015, 

and August 2, 2019, of whom 455 underwent randomization. Of the 302 patients assigned 

to ctDNA-guided management, 8 (3%) were excluded from the intention-to-treat population,

and of the 153 patients assigned to standard management, 6 (4%) were excluded (Fig. S1). 

A successful ctDNA analysis was performed for 291 of 294 patients (99%) in the ctDNA-

guided group. Of these patients, only 2 did not receive ctDNA-guided management of their 

disease. Of the 45 ctDNA-positive patients in the ctDNA-guided group, 1 did not receive 

adjuvant chemotherapy, and 1 ctDNA-negative patient received chemotherapy. The median 

follow-up from randomization to database lock for analysis (October 15, 2021) was 37 

months (37 months in the ctDNA-guided group and 38 months in the standard-management 

group).

The baseline characteristics of the patients in the main analysis population were generally 

balanced between the two groups, with the exception of a higher percentage of patients 

in the ctDNA-guided group than in the standard-management group having tumors on 

the right side (Tables 1 and S3). The median age of the patients was 64 years, and the 

majority of patients (99%) had an ECOG performance-status score of 0 or 1. T4 disease was 

present in 15% of the patients, and 5% had a lymph node yield of less than 12. Clinical 

high-risk disease, defined as one or more clinicopathological risk features (T4, poor tumor 

differentiation, lymph node yield <12, lymphovascular invasion, tumor perforation, or bowel 

obstruction) in association with a proficient mismatch-repair tumor, was present in 176 

patients (40%). The baseline characteristics of the patients in the per-protocol population are 

shown in Table S2.

TREATMENT DELIVERED

A summary of the treatment delivered and adherence in both trial groups is provided in 

Table 2. A lower percentage of patients in the ctDNA-guided group than in the standard-

management group received adjuvant chemotherapy (15% vs. 28%; relative risk, 1.82; 95% 

confidence interval [CI], 1.25 to 2.65). This difference was observed across almost all 

patient subgroups, with the exception of patients with a lymph node yield of less than 12 

and patients older than 70 years of age (Fig. 1); the most notable difference was seen among 

patients with T4 or poorly differentiated tumors (relative risk, 2.57 and 5.06, respectively). 

For patients with high-risk clinicopathological features, the likelihood of receiving adjuvant 

chemotherapy was 2.14 times as high in the standard-management group as in the ctDNA-

guided group.

Among those who received adjuvant chemotherapy, an oxaliplatin-based doublet was 

administered to a higher percentage of patients in the ctDNA-guided group than in the 

standardmanagement group (62% vs. 10%). In total, 8 of 86 patients (9%) with deficient 

mismatch-repair tumors received adjuvant chemotherapy, 6 (75%) of whom (including 

4 patients in the ctDNA-guided group) were treated with oxaliplatin-based combination 

chemotherapy. The median time to the start of treatment after surgery was longer in the 

ctDNA-guided group than in the standard-management group (83 days vs. 53 days); this 

difference was driven by the wait time for the ctDNA result. No patient had disease 

recurrence during this waiting period.

EFFICACY ACCORDING TO TREATMENT GROUP

At the time of database lock, 43 events of disease recurrence or death had occurred. 

Noninferiority of ctDNA-guided management to standard management was confirmed in the 

intention-to-treat population for both 2-year recurrence-free survival (absolute difference, 

1.1 percentage points; 95% CI, −4.1 to 6.2) and the percentage of patients with recurrence 

within 2 years in the time-to-event analysis (absolute difference, 0.7 percentage points; 

95% CI, −4.3 to 5.7) (Figs. 2A, S2, S3, and S4). The percentages of patients surviving 

without disease recurrence at 2 years and at 3 years were similar in the ctDNA-guided 

group and the standard-management group (2-year recurrence-free survival, 93.5% and 

92.4%, respectively; 3-year recurrence-free survival, 91.7% and 92.4%, respectively; hazard 

ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.51 to 1.82) (Fig. 2B). The analysis involving the per-protocol 

population provided similar results (Figs. S6 and S7). Results were also generally similar in 

prespecified subgroup analyses (Fig. S5).

OUTCOMES ACCORDING TO CTDNA STATUS IN THE CTDNA-GUIDED GROUP

In the ctDNA-guided group, recurrence or death occurred in 15 of 246 ctDNA-negative 

patients (6%) and 8 of 45 ctDNA-positive patients (18%). The estimated 3-year recurrence-

free survival was 92.5% among ctDNA-negative patients and 86.4% among ctDNA-positive 

patients (hazard ratio, 1.83; 95% CI, 0.79 to 4.27) (Fig. 3), and the percentage of 

patients who had had a recurrence at 3 years was 7% among ctDNA-negative patients, 

as compared with 14% among ctDNA-positive patients (hazard ratio, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.00 

to 5.99) (Fig. S8). Among the ctDNA-positive patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, 

3-year recurrence-free survival was 92.6% among those who received oxaliplatin-based 

chemotherapy and 76.0% among those who received single-agent fluoropyrimidine 

chemotherapy.

In accordance with current guidelines, clinicians routinely base treatment recommendations 

on clinical risk, with a T4 tumor being the strongest risk factor.6–8 In a post hoc exploratory 

analysis, we examined the effect of ctDNA-negative status on recurrence-free survival 

among patients with low-risk or high-risk disease and T3 or T4 tumors. Among ctDNA-

negative patients, 3-year recurrence-free survival was higher among patients with clinical 

low-risk cancers than among those with high-risk cancers (96.7% vs. 85.1%; hazard ratio, 

3.04; 95% CI, 1.26 to 7.34) (Fig. S9). Similarly, 3-year recurrence-free survival was higher 

among patients with T3 tumors than among those with T4 tumors (94.2% vs. 81.3%; 

hazard ratio, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.01 to 6.71) (Fig. S10). We did not investigate the effect of 

ctDNA-positive status according to clinical risk because of the small total number of patients 

with a ctDNA-positive result.

DISCUSSION

The risk of cancer recurrence after curative-intent surgery for solid tumors has traditionally 

been estimated on the basis of formal histologic assessment of the resected specimen. This 

type of analysis defines the tumor stage and determines the presence of any adverse features, 

which inform the use of adjuvant chemotherapy. Efforts to improve treatment and outcomes 

in stage II colon cancer have explored the effect of various adjuvant therapy combinations

or have been aimed at defining a subgroup of patients who are most likely to derive benefit 

from treatment. To date, such approaches have led to limited progress. In this trial, we 

found that a ctDNA-guided approach reduced the number of patients who received adjuvant 

therapy and did not alter the risk of recurrence. Furthermore, ctDNA-positive patients 

appeared to derive considerable benefit from adjuvant treatment, given the low percentage of 

patients with recurrence in this trial as compared with previously reported high recurrence 

rates in this subgroup of patients when no adjuvant chemotherapy was administered.15,24 We 

confirm the very low risk of recurrence in untreated ctDNA-negative patients.

Across various cohorts of patients with non-metastatic colon cancer and resected colorectal 

liver metastases, the percentage of patients with disease recurrence among those who had 

detectable ctDNA and did not receive adjuvant therapy has consistently been in excess of 

80%.15,24–28 The time to recurrence in these studies was also short; all untreated ctDNA-

positive patients in our previous study of stage II colon cancer had disease recurrence 

within 2 years.15 In this context, the percentage of patients with recurrence within 3 

years among the treated ctDNA-positive patients in the current trial (14%) is encouraging, 

notwithstanding the longer median time to chemotherapy commencement in the ctDNA-

guided group of 11.9 weeks, as compared with the guidelines-recommended time of 8 weeks 

or less after surgery.8 However, more mature data are needed to rule out the possibility 

that the treatment of ctDNA-positive patients with chemotherapy may have delayed rather 

than prevented recurrence in some instances. It is conceivable that earlier initiation of 

chemotherapy for ctDNA-positive patients could lead to even more favorable outcomes. 

Because the turnaround time from the time a blood specimen is obtained to the time a 

ctDNA result is available is approximately 2 weeks, it would be useful for future studies 

to consider analyzing blood specimens at week 4 and week 7 after surgery (or later) 

sequentially instead of concurrently, with a positive week 4 ctDNA result triggering the start 

of adjuvant chemotherapy within the time frame recommended in guidelines. In addition, 

serial ctDNA analysis for patients who are ctDNA-negative after surgery may reduce the risk 

of undertreatment because of an initially false negative ctDNA result.

At the clinician’s discretion, the majority of ctDNA-positive patients in the ctDNA-guided 

group received oxaliplatin-based therapy rather than fluoropyrimidine alone. This approach 

was likely to have been driven by the known prognostic significance of ctDNA positivity 

and previous data suggesting a benefit for oxaliplatin-based therapy in patients with high-

risk stage II colon cancer.23 Given the fact that our trial design predates the International 

Duration Evaluation of Adjuvant Therapy (IDEA) meta-analysis,29 the majority of patients 

were scheduled for 24 weeks of treatment, with 84% of the patients in the ctDNA-guided 

group and 78% of those in the standard-management group completing the planned 

treatment. Although we observed numerically better recurrence-free survival among ctDNA-

positive patients treated with oxaliplatin-based treatment than among those treated with 

single-agent fluoropyrimidine, this finding should be considered hypothesis-generating only. 

Further studies with much larger sample sizes will be required in order to define the 

relative effect of fluoropyrimidine alone as compared with an oxaliplatin-based combination 

regimen, as well as to define appropriate treatment duration in this subgroup of patients.

Along with defining a subgroup of patients with stage II colon cancer who benefit from 

adjuvant therapy, defining a subgroup in whom treatment can be avoided with minimal 

risk of recurrence is also an important goal. To this end, our results indicated an overall 

very low risk of recurrence in untreated patients who were ctDNA-negative, with 3-year 

recurrence-free survival of 92.5%. Given the current focus of using clinicopathological 

risk to select patients with stage II colon cancer for adjuvant therapy,6–8,23 we explored 

outcomes among patients with high-risk or low-risk disease. Most notable was the 3-

year recurrence-free survival of 96.7% among patients with low-risk disease, indicating 

that adjuvant therapy should not be considered for ctDNA-negative patients who are at 

clinicopathological low risk. This is an important observation, because in routine clinical 

practice adjuvant chemotherapy is still administered to some patients at low risk (11% in our 

standard-management group), particularly younger patients.

The strength of our trial is the random assignment of patients to receive ctDNA-guided 

or standard treatment. However, there are several limitations. The trial was adequately 

powered to address the primary end point, but a larger trial might have provided more 

definitive findings for specific patient subgroups. We did not examine the effect of a 

ctDNA-guided approach beyond the initial decision for adjuvant chemotherapy, because 

this would have compromised the trial end points. We did not randomly assign the ctDNA-

positive and ctDNA-negative patients to receive treatment or no treatment, a trial design 

that would have provided more definitive evidence of the effect of treatment or lack thereof 

in each subgroup. Multiple other groups are exploring additional ways in which ctDNA 

analysis could inform adjuvant therapy for nonmetastatic colon cancer, including therapeutic 

approaches in patients who remain ctDNA-positive after completing standard adjuvant 

therapy (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT03803553 and NCT03832569, among other 

studies30–36). Data from these studies are eagerly awaited.

The results of this trial suggest that a survival benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy may be 

obtained in a well-defined subgroup of patients with stage II colon cancer — namely, those 

with detectable ctDNA after surgery. Treating only the patients who had detectable ctDNA 

reduced the percentage of patients who received adjuvant therapy as compared with standard 

management and did not compromise recurrence-free survival.

Figure 1. Receipt of Adjuvant Chemotherapy in the Intention-to-Treat Population According to 
Subgroup.
The relative risk and 95% confidence intervals for the receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy 

in the standard-management group as compared with the circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)–

guided group are shown. The intention-to-treat population included all eligible patients who 

underwent randomization and had both week 4 and week 7 postsurgical blood specimens. 

The size of each square corresponds to the size of the subgroup. For the subgroup with 

poorly differentiated tumors, the relative risk lies beyond the upper limit of the horizontal 

axis and is not shown.

Figure 2. Outcomes with ctDNA-Guided as Compared with Standard Management in the 
Intention-to-Treat Population.
Panel A shows the absolute difference in recurrence-free survival over time between the 

ctDNA-guided and standard-management groups; shading indicates the 95% confidence 

interval. The noninferiority margin of −8.5 percentage points for the primary end point of 

recurrence-free survival at 2 years is indicated by the dashed red line; the I bar indicates the 

95% confidence interval at 2 years, the lower bound of which (−4.1 percentage points) lies 

above −8.5 percentage points, which confirms noninferiority of ctDNA-guided management 

to standard management. Kaplan–Meier estimates of recurrence-free survival according to
