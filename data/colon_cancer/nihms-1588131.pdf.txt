Abstract

Introduction: Adherence to breast and colorectal cancer screening reduce mortality from these 

cancers, yet screening rates remain suboptimal. This 2 X 2 RCT compared three theory-based 

interventions to usual care to simultaneously increase breast and colon cancer screening in women 

who were non adherent to both at study entry.

Study design: RCT.

Setting/participants: Women (N=692) who were non-adherent to both breast and colon cancer 

screening and aged 51–75 years were recruited. Enrollment, intervention delivery, and data 

collection were completed between 2013 and 2017 and data analyzed in 2018.

Intervention: The randomized intervention included four groups: three intervention arms 

(personally tailored messages using a web-based intervention, phone delivery by a trained 

navigator, or both) compared to usual care. Women at average risk for colon cancer were allowed 

to select either colonoscopy or stool test as their preferred colon cancer screening. Mammography 

was promoted for breast cancer screening.

Main outcome measures: Outcome data at 6 months included self-report and medical records 

for screening activity.

Results: All intervention arms significantly increased receipt of either a mammogram or 

stool test compared with control (web: p<0.0249, phone: p<0.0001, web + phone: p<0.0001). 

When considering receipt of both mammogram and stool test, all intervention arms were 

significantly different from usual care (web: p<0.0249, phone: p<0.0003, web + phone: p<0.0001). 

Additionally, women who were adherent to mammography had a 4.5 times greater odds of 

becoming adherent to colonoscopy.

Conclusions: The tailored intervention simultaneously supporting both breast and colon cancer 

screening significantly improved rates of obtaining one of the screenings and increased receipt of 

both tests.

INTRODUCTION

Breast cancer (BC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) together account for 22% of all 

cancer deaths among U.S. women, despite the fact that guideline-based screening could 

significantly reduce mortality from both cancers.1 Both BC and CRC screening rates are 

low among U.S. women, with 64% adherent to BC screening and 62.2% adherent to CRC 

guidelines.2 Current recommendations for average-risk women include mammography either 

annually (screening can start at age 40 years) or biannually (for those aged 55 years and 

older), and the choice of multiple CRC screening tests (e.g., fecal immunochemical test 

[FIT] annually or colonoscopy every 10 years) for individuals aged 50–75 years.1,2

In the last 2 decades, tailored interventions to increase either BC or CRC screening alone 

have been tested using a variety of media.3–10 Most studies have found that tailored 

messages significantly increased screening and that interventions with several points of 

contact (e.g., print and telephone) were generally more effective than a single contact.

Although interventions targeting only one screening have dominated the research literature, 

a few researchers have investigated interventions to simultaneously increase BC and 

CRC screening. For instance, low-income participants were randomized to mailed letters, 

automated telephone messaging, mailed stool blood kits, and point-of-care prompts 

compared to usual care. Both BC screening and CRC screening were increased with the 

biggest increase realized in CRC screening after mailed receipt of a stool blood kit.11 

A second study randomized primary care patients to either personalized mailed letters, 

automated telephone calls, or a combination of both that included messages for the needed 

screening (mammography, CRC screening, or both).

Researchers found a significant intervention effect for combining a personalized letter 

and automated call compared with an intervention using either alone.12 Most recently, a

two-group delayed treatment trial randomized 116,407 Medicaid participants who were 

overdue for one or both screenings to a persuasive messaging letter for either mammography 

or colonoscopy with telephone support coupled with a $20 incentive if screening was 

completed. Separate letters were sent as prompts for encouraging mammography or CRC 

screening depending on need. Both receipt of a mammogram and colonoscopy were 

significantly higher in the treatment group than control.13

Both breast and colon cancer share common risk factors such as age and family history, 

and not surprisingly, research has demonstrated that screening behaviors for BC and CRC 

are positively correlated.14,15 Although some interventions have included both BC and CRC 

screening messages simultaneously, most have delivered separate messages, not capitalizing 

on the potential that increasing one screening may enhance the intervention effect on 

the other. In a combined intervention delivered simultaneously, women from federally 

qualified health clinics in rural Louisiana who were non-adherent to both breast and colon 

cancer screening were randomized to enhanced care, health literacy–informed education, or 

health literacy–informed education with nurse support. The combination of health literacy 

education and nurse support was more than two times more effective in increasing both 

screenings than health literacy–informed education only.16

The current randomized prospective trial supported by the National Cancer Institute sought 

to simultaneously increase both BC and CRC screening in women who were non-adherent to 

both screening behaviors. A 2 X 2 factorial design was used to test tailored content delivered 

by a web intervention, a phone intervention, or a combination of both the web and phone 

intervention compared to usual care. Tailored intervention content included messages for 

perceived and actual risk, knowledge, benefits and barriers to screening, self-efficacy, test 

preference, and access to obtaining a stool blood test or information promoting scheduling 

mammography or colonoscopy. If women had a strong family history of CRC, as defined by 

the American Cancer Society, the intervention focused on colonoscopy as the recommended 

CRC screening modality.17,18 Women were identified as higher than average risk if they had 

one first-degree relative who was diagnosed with colorectal cancer before age 60 years or 

two first-degree relatives diagnosed after age 60 years. If the woman was at average risk, she 

was allowed to choose either a stool test or colonoscopy as a preferred screening. Although 

the desired outcome was receipt of both a mammogram and CRC screening test, obtaining at 

least one of the tests was also a desirable outcome. Therefore, research questions that guided 

the study for this dual outcome intervention were:

1. Is there a difference between usual care and the intervention arms (web, phone, 

or web + phone intervention) on adherence to obtaining either a mammogram 

or CRC screening, or both a mammogram and CRC (stool test or colonoscopy) 

screening?

2. Did women who became adherent to mammography by 6 months post-

intervention (atTime 3 [T3]) have greater odds of becoming adherent to any 

CRC screening (stool test or colonoscopy) at T3?

METHODS

This study was a subset analysis of an RCT reported in another manuscript.19 About half 

of women accrued to the parent study were adherent to BC screening but not adherent to 

CRC screening, and half were non-adherent to both CRC and BC screening. This manuscript 

details the intervention and outcomes delivered to this subset of women non-adherent to both 

screenings. Figure 1 illustrates the consort diagram for the women who were non-adherent 

to both CRC and BC screening.

Study Sample

Two healthcare systems that included primary care practices participated. Medical records 

from each healthcare system identified women non-adherent to both BC and CRC screening. 

An encrypted file of women identified as non-adherent was sent to a Survey Center 

supported through Indiana University. The Survey Center sent mailed letters explaining 

the study with a postage paid opt-out postcard or an 800 opt-out number if they did not 

want to be contacted. Women who had not opted out by 2 weeks were called by the Survey 

Center and if they expressed interest, verbal confirmation of breast and colorectal cancer 

screening status was obtained by trained interviewers. Following verbal consent, women 

were randomized to one of four groups: (1) usual care, (2) tailored web-based program, 

(3) tailored phone counseling, or (4) a web-based and phone counseling intervention. 

Randomization to study arm was performed in a Microsoft SQL database, using SQL 

random ordering functions without stratification. Women were interviewed at baseline 

followed by an intervention that simultaneously encouraged being screened for BC and 

CRC. Women were again interviewed at 4 weeks and 6 months post-intervention. Following 

verbal consent and baseline interview, a Health Portability and Accountability Form was 

mailed to enrolled participants to allow investigators to access medical records at 6 months. 

Participants also had the opportunity to complete the medical records release form online. 

Medical records were abstracted at 6 months to confirm self-reported screening data. A 

$20 gift certificate was mailed to participants following each data collection. Women were 

enrolled, intervention delivered, and all data collected between 2013 and 2017. The study 

was approved by the IRB at Indiana University and at the health system level. This study is 

registered with the clinical trials identifier NCT03279198 at www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Women aged 51–75 years who were non-adherent to CRC and BC screening guidelines 

and had access to the Internet were eligible to participate. Non-adherence was defined by 

not having: either a fecal occult blood test or a FIT in the last 15 months, sigmoidoscopy 

>5 years ago, or colonoscopy >10 years ago and a mammogram in the last 15 months. 

Although guidelines for both mammogram and FIT called for annual testing, a 15-month 

window for FIT and mammogram allowed a grace period for annual screening before 

women were considered non-adherent. Women were excluded from the study if they had: a 

personal history of CRC, colorectal polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease and any medical 

conditions that would prohibit CRC screening. At baseline, information on family history of 

CRC and BC was obtained.

Intervention

The tailored messages supporting the interventions were developed based on the Theory 

of Planned Behavior, Health Belief Model, and Transtheoretical Model, which identified 

demographic variables, knowledge and beliefs, and past experiences to predict behavior 

change.20–25

The web-based program was built to provide tailored messages based on the individual’s 

knowledge; perceived and actual risk of BC and CRC; and benefits, barriers, and self-

efficacy for both BC and CRC screening. The web-based program first queried women about 

demographics and cancer/screening-related beliefs. After women entered answers to queries, 

tailored messages were delivered in real time via an algorithm built into the interactive 

program. Because women were non-adherent to both BC and CRC screenings, intervention 

messages simultaneously addressed the need to become adherent to both screenings. Women 

at higher-than-average risk for CRC received an intervention that encouraged colonoscopy 

for CRC screening, whereas women at average risk could select either stool test or 

colonoscopy followed by program content consistent with their preferred test. Video clips 

illustrated the screening procedures of mammography, stool tests, and colonoscopy. Audio 

dialogue accompanied each question, allowing women with low literacy to use the program. 

The web-based program had a talk show format. Women who had not completed the 

intervention by 4 weeks were sent a reminder e-mail.

A single phone-based tailored intervention (average time of 19 minutes) delivered tailored 

messages consistent with algorithms used in the web-based programing. Participants were 

asked if they wanted a mailed FIT or scheduling of an appointment. Phone interventionists 

were trained during a 2-day program with role playing. With the consent of the participant, 

all telephone interventions were audio recorded for quality control, and the audio tapes were 

later reviewed for appropriate delivery of content using a fidelity checklist.

The combined intervention prompted women to first complete the web program followed by 

the phone intervention that was delivered 2–4 weeks later. The average time for delivery of 

the phone intervention in this arm was similar to the average time used to deliver the phone 

intervention alone (19 minutes).

Women received usual care from their healthcare providers and depending on the provider 

may have received a postcard reminder for cancer screenings.

Measures

Demographic variables, family history, and cancer screening history were assessed using 

standard questions at baseline and at 6 months. Screening beliefs were assessed with scales 

that have been developed and tested for validity and reliability in past research.26–28 The 

belief scales assessed perceived risk, self-efficacy, fatalism, fear, as well as benefits of and 

barriers to BC and CRC screening. Intent to screen for BC and CRC were assessed by 

questions used in past research.29

The outcomes of interest were defined as either: receipt of either a mammogram or 

CRC screening (stool test or colonoscopy) or receipt of both a CRC screening test and

mammogram. The outcomes were assessed with a combination of a 6-month self-report and 

medical records audit (Figure 2). Use of both self-report and medical record data served to 

decrease potential bias due to missing data in either interview or medical record information. 

The κ coefficient of chance-corrected agreement between self-report and medical records 

among those who had both sources of data was 0.71 for mammography, 0.76 for stool test, 

and 0.85 for colonoscopy. If either self-report or medical records indicated that a screening 

test was received, the outcome variable was scored as “yes.”

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were conducted in 2018. All groups were compared for distributional 

properties on baseline characteristics using the general linear model omnibus F-test for 

continuous variables and Pearson chi-square test for categorical variables. A binary logistic 

regression was used for analyses of intervention effect. Demographic and other theoretically 

based variables were entered as potential confounders of the relationship between the 

interventions and mammography or CRC screening.30 Wald chi-square tests, AORs, and 

95% CIs were used to test independent variables and covariates in the logistic regression 

models. Interactions between the intervention and baseline covariates were tested for 

potential moderating effects. All tests were two-sided, using α=0.05, except moderating 

effects, which were tested using α=0.01 because they were considered exploratory. The 

study was designed to achieve a sample size of ≥100 in each of the three groups at 6 months, 

considering attrition, to insure ≥80% power to detect 20% differences in 6-month screening 

between any pair of randomized groups. Table 2 shows the total and group sample sizes 

unadjusted for covariates. The Table 3 footnote provides analysis sample sizes for models 

adjusted for covariates which was slightly greater on average than 100 per arm. An intent-to-

treat analysis was used (i.e., participants were analyzed according to randomized groups 

regardless of behavioral dosage of intervention received and the study team attempted to 

obtain medical record-based screening outcomes for all women including for participants 

who were missing their follow-up interviews).

RESULTS

A total of 692 women met eligibility, signed a written consent form, and were randomized 

to one of the four groups (Figure 1). Although groups were randomized, a few baseline 

characteristics are expected to differ by chance. Randomized groups were significantly 

different at the 0.05 level for the number the times they saw a healthcare provider in 

the past year, total number of self-reported health problems, limitation of activities due 

to depression (yes versus no), and BMI. These were included as covariates along with 

other theoretically identified variables, all of which are known to be least moderately 

associated with the screening outcomes (Table 1). Furthermore, estimated SEs were similar 

for adjusted and unadjusted models, and Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit tests were not 

significant (α=0.05) for any models, demonstrating absence of overfitting and model misfit, 

respectively. The average age for women across intervention groups was 58.7 (SD=6.0) 

years. More than 28% completed ≥4 years of college, 43% completed some college, and 

29% completed high school or less. Most women were Caucasian (85%). Of note, only 26%

were included in the normal BMI category; 27% were considered overweight and 47% were 

obese.

Research Question 1: Is there a difference, while controlling for baseline characteristics, 

between usual care and the intervention arms (web, phone, or web + phone intervention) 

on adherence to obtaining either a mammogram or CRC screening, or both a mammogram 

and CRC screening? Unadjusted rates are shown in Table 2; results are emphasized while 

controlling for baseline-imbalanced variables and theoretically potentially confounding 

covariates. In Table 3, AORs are listed by intervention groups for receipt of either 

mammogram or stool test or both, and receipt of either mammogram or colonoscopy or 

both. Tests for receipt of either mammogram or stool test indicated that all intervention 

arms were significantly more efficacious than usual care: (web: p<0.0249, phone: p<0.0001, 

web + phone: p<0.0001). Receipt of either mammogram or colonoscopy did not differ by 

intervention arms and usual care (Table 3).

The second part of Research Question 1 was to determine if intervention groups differed 

when the outcome was receipt of both BC and CRC screening (either stool test or 

colonoscopy). When considering the outcome of receiving both mammogram and stool test, 

all intervention arms were significantly different from usual care: (web: p<0.0249, phone: 

p=0.0003, web + phone: p<0.0001) (Table 3). When considering both a mammogram and 

colonoscopy, intervention groups did not differ from usual care. No moderation effect was 

found for analyses of Research Question 1. A sensitivity analysis was run for participants 

missing both medical record and interview for T3 screening outcome. When it was assumed 

missing data be “no” for the screening outcomes, results were similar to findings reported in 

Table 3.

Research Question 2: Did women who became adherent to mammography by 6 months 

post-intervention (at T3) have a greater odds of becoming adherent to any CRC screening 

(stool test or colonoscopy) at T3? A binary logistic regression model was used to test 

the association between adherence to BC screening and CRC screening, with stool test 

or colonoscopy as dependent variables. The independent variable of interest was T3 

mammography screening, and the baseline characteristics were adjusted for as in the 

earlier models. There was not a significant interaction between the association of T3 

mammography screening, and either T3 stool screening or T3 colonoscopy screening, by 

randomized groups. Therefore, results are shown for all groups combined (Table 4). Women 

who became adherent to a mammogram at 6 months post-intervention did not have a greater 

odds to complete a stool test (p<0.1574) but had a 4.5 times greater odds to complete 

a colonoscopy (p<0.001) while controlling for demographic and theoretically important 

variables.

DISCUSSION

When testing an intervention that was designed to simultaneously increase adherence to both 

BC and CRC screening, all three intervention arms significantly increased women getting 

either a mammogram or a stool test and also increased the receipt of obtaining both a 

mammogram and stool test. However, the intervention arms varied in effectiveness. Women

in the web-only intervention had more than two times greater odds of receiving at least one 

screening (mammogram or stool test), whereas women in an intervention arm who received 

a phone call had five to six times greater odds of receiving at least one of the screenings. The 

obvious efficacy of the phone component in promoting either BC screening or stool testing 

over usual care, with effect sizes larger than that for web over usual care, was probably 

influenced by the telephone interventionist offering a mailed stool kit to be returned in 

a postage-paid envelope. A smaller effect size in the web-only group could be related to 

intervention uptake, which was less for women in the web-only group (n=81) compared 

with the phone group (n=26) and phone + web group (n=33). The web intervention required 

participants to call a toll-free number and actively request a stool test be mailed to their 

home. By contrast, there was not a significant effect for any intervention when considering 

uptake of mammography and colonoscopy.

Two issues may be relevant to the significant intervention effect on stool test. First, average-

risk women comprised 95% of the sample, and these women were allowed to select either 

a stool test or colonoscopy to complete CRC screening. Most women (66%) selected stool 

testing as their preferred screening test. Myers et al.31 found that those with a personal 

preference for stool test compared with colonoscopy were more likely to be screened 

following a personal navigation, which was essentially the active component of this study’s 

phone intervention. Other research has found that directly mailing stool test kits significantly 

increased CRC screening rates.32 By contrast, a multimodal intervention in a safety net 

primary care practice found a significant increase in CRC screening intervention compared 

with control (37.7% vs 16.7%) when participants were allowed to select type of CRC 

screening.33 Therefore, when the preferred CRC screening test was a stool test, interventions 

significantly increased receipt of either breast or CRC screening compared with controls.

In this study, the overall purpose of developing interventions targeting dual screenings was 

to simultaneously increase screening for both BC and CRC. The authors did not adjust α 
for multiple pairwise comparisons between randomized intervention and usual care arms on 

outcomes because these were pre-planned comparisons; however, this write-up emphasizes 

that the findings for any CRC screening were largely driven by the stool screening outcome. 

All intervention arms were significant in increasing the likelihood of a woman receiving 

both a mammogram and stool test. The intervention arms which included a phone contact 

had more than twice the effect of the web intervention alone.

It is interesting to note that in all intervention arms, the intervention effect for increasing 

both mammogram and stool test simultaneously had greater ORs than those associated with 

increasing only one screening. Women in the web intervention arm had more than five 

times greater odds of receiving both a mammogram and stool test compared with usual 

care. Based on these data, the authors are 95% confident that women in the population 

receiving a phone intervention have at least three times greater odds than usual care and 

women in the web + phone intervention have at least four times greater odds of receiving 

both screenings, and that the true population ORs are likely much larger than this (i.e., the 

best estimates from the data are ORs of 13 and 18). It is noted, however, that their 95% 

CIs are wide, and therefore the authors emphasize the lower limit of their 95% CI instead 

of their particular point estimates. In a study in underserved counties in South Carolina,

Davis and colleagues16 studied the effect of an intervention to simultaneously increase both 

mammography and stool testing comparing educational materials delivered in clinic with 

and without adding nurse navigation. All patients received a stool kit at clinic visit. The 

nurse supported arm showed a significantly greater increase in obtaining both screenings 

than either of the compared intervention arms, although all groups received a stool kit. As 

the intervention arms in this study that included personal navigation via phone also included 

automatic mailing of a stool test, the authors cannot unravel the effect that personal contact 

had compared to automatic receipt of a stool kit. Their prior analyses demonstrated that 

significant interventions effects were probably due to mailing a stool kit.19

An underlying assumption of this study was that promoting screening simultaneously for 

BC and CRC would increase the likelihood that both tests would be completed. When 

considering all groups, this study found that when women received a mammogram, they had 

4.5 times greater odds of receiving a colonoscopy but did not have significantly greater odds 

of receiving a stool test. Perhaps the fact that receiving both a mammogram and colonoscopy 

required making an appointment outside of the normal healthcare visit accounted for the 

association between these two behaviors.

To the authors’ knowledge, this is the only simultaneous intervention supporting both BC 

and CRC screening that assessed the intervention effect of obtaining both screenings. 

The intervention effect for obtaining both screenings was significant only for women 

who selected a stool test instead of colonoscopy. However, when considering all groups 

irrespective of intervention, there was not an association between obtaining a mammogram 

and stool test, whereas there was an association between receiving a mammogram and 

colonoscopy.

Limitations

Results may not be generalizable to populations outside of a healthcare system. Women 

enrolled in this study were insured members of two healthcare systems who were non-

adherent to both BC and CRC screening and who consented to be in this randomized trial. 

The majority of participants were Caucasian. Additionally, although all women who were 

enrolled had access to a web-based program, some women assigned to the computer group 

may have been more comfortable with technology than others. It is also possible that some 

women did not have a computer within their home and had to use public facilities such 

as a library. However, as technology and Internet access increase, problems with access 

will decrease. With the advent and penetration of smartphones, programs such as the one 

reported here could be used on personal devices, making interactive programs easier and 

more compelling to use.

CONCLUSIONS

The tailored intervention simultaneously supporting both BC and CRC screening 

significantly improved rates of obtaining one of the screenings (either mammogram or 

stool test) and increased receipt of both tests in women for whom a high percentage (66%) 

selected stool testing as their screening test of choice for colorectal cancer. A second 

question sought to determine the association of becoming adherent to CRC screening

if a mammogram was received regardless of intervention effect. A strong association 

existed between receiving a mammogram and obtaining a colonoscopy, but no association 

between receiving a mammogram and stool blood test. Intervention arms did not affect this 

association.

a
Models were adjusted for baseline characteristics including mammography medical record indicator, health site, age, race (African American 

vs Other), education, income, marital status, BMI, whether depression limits patient’s activities (yes/no), family history of 1or more blood 
relatives with colon cancer (yes/no), family history of 1 or more blood relatives with breast cancer (yes/no), perceivedrisk of breast cancer, 
doctor recommendation for mammography (yes/no), number of past-year primary care visits excluding eye care and dentistry (≥3), number 
of self-reported health problems, baseline stage of readiness, and scale scores measuring knowledge, susceptibility, benefits, fear, fatalism, 
self-efficacy, and barriers. Self-efficacy and barriers that were specific for mammography and CRC screening were used in all models.

b
Multinomial Logistic Regression Model (reference category = T3 Neither Mammogram nor CRC).

c
Removed doctor recommendation for mammography (yes/no) and mammography medical record indicator from baseline covariates due to 

quasi-complete separation if included.
