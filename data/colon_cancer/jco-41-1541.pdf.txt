abstract

PURPOSE Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has potential advantages over standard postoperative chemo-
therapy for locally advanced colon cancer but requires formal evaluation.

METHODS Patients with radiologically staged T3-4, N0-2, M0 colon cancer were randomly allocated (2:1) to
6 weeks oxaliplatin-fluoropyrimidine preoperatively plus 18 postoperatively (NAC group) or 24 weeks post-
operatively (control group). Patients with RAS-wildtype tumors could also be randomly assigned 1:1 to receive
panitumumab or not during NAC. The primary end point was residual disease or recurrence within 2 years.
Secondary outcomes included surgical morbidity, histopathologic stage, regression grade, completeness of
resection, and cause-specific mortality. Log-rank analyses were by intention-to-treat.

RESULTS Of 699 patients allocated to NAC, 674 (96%) started and 606 (87%) completed NAC. In total,
686 of 699 (98.1%) NAC patients and 351 of 354 (99.2%) control patients underwent surgery. Thirty
patients (4.3%) allocated to NAC developed obstructive symptoms requiring expedited surgery, but there
were fewer serious postoperative complications with NAC than with control. NAC produced marked T
and N downstaging and histologic tumor regression (all P , .001). Resection was more often histo-
pathologically complete: 94% (648/686) versus 89% (311/351), P , .001. Fewer NAC than control
patients had residual or recurrent disease within 2 years (16.9% [118/699] v 21.5% [76/354]; rate ratio,
0.72 [95% CI, 0.54 to 0.98]; P 5 .037). Tumor regression correlated strongly with freedom from re-
currence. Panitumumab did not enhance the benefit from NAC. Little benefit from NAC was seen in
mismatch repair–deficient tumors.

CONCLUSION Six weeks of preoperative oxaliplatin-fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy for operable colon cancer can
be delivered safely, without increasing perioperative morbidity. This chemotherapy regimen, when given
preoperatively, produces marked histopathologic down-staging, fewer incomplete resections, and better 2-year
disease control. Histologic regression after NAC is a strong predictor of lower postoperative recurrence risk so
has potential use as a guide for postoperative therapy. Six weeks of NAC should be considered as a treatment
option for locally advanced colon cancer.

INTRODUCTION

Colorectal cancer is the second commonest cancer
worldwide, with 1.7 million diagnoses annually.1

Standard treatment is surgery followed by adju-
vant oxaliplatin-fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy for
those with a moderate- to high-risk disease.2 Despite
adjuvant chemotherapy (AC), 20%-30% of patients
develop recurrent disease that is usually
incurable.3,4 Preoperative or neoadjuvant chemo-
therapy (NAC) has substantially improved outcomes
in other gastrointestinal cancers5,6 and has potential
advantages over postoperative AC in colon cancer.
Shrinking tumors before surgery may reduce the risk
of incomplete resection and tumor cell-shedding

during surgery.7 NAC can start many weeks ear-
lier than AC so could be more effective in eradicating
micrometastases,8 particularly as surgery induces
growth factor activity, potentially stimulating tumor
proliferation before AC is started.9 In addition, re-
sponse to NAC, unlike AC, is observable, so could
potentially guide subsequent treatment decisions.

However, there are potential disadvantages of NAC
that have delayed its evaluation in colon cancer. Might
toxicity during NAC compromise fitness for surgery or
increase perioperative complications? Might chemo-
resistant cancers progress during NAC reducing the
chance of surgical cure? Given the imprecision of
radiologic staging, might low-risk patients be exposed

to the toxicities and inconvenience of chemotherapy when
surgery alone might have been considered sufficient?

By 2008, oxaliplatin-fluoropyrimidine combinations had
demonstrated good efficacy and tolerability as both adju-
vant and advanced disease treatment,3,10 and spiral
computed tomography (CT) scans could more reliably
identify moderate- to high-risk colon cancers.11 We
therefore initiated Fluorouracil, Oxaliplatin and Targeted
Receptor pre-Operative Therapy (FOxTROT),12 a ran-
domized trial assessing the benefits and risks of advancing
part of standard AC into the NAC setting. A short duration of
NAC—just 6 weeks—was chosen to minimize the risk of
on-treatment progression or residual toxicity.10,13 The
planned total duration of chemotherapy was equal in both
arms, allowing evaluation of sequencing rather than du-
ration. An optional subrandomization evaluated whether, as
in RAS-wildtype (wt) metastatic disease,12,14,15 adding
panitumumab enhances response to NAC. An internal
safety and feasibility pilot was included.12

METHODS

Trial Procedures

The initial factorial (2 3 2) design randomly assigned par-
ticipants 2:1 to NAC-surgery-AC (NAC group) versus surgery-
AC (control group), with RAS-wt tumors also randomly
assigned 1:1 to receive panitumumab or not during the first
6 weeks of chemotherapy. From June 2011, with the addition
of cetuximab to AC having proven ineffective,16,17 the pan-
itumumab subrandomization was restricted to the NAC group.
In 2014, with ongoing international studies examining 12-week
AC,4 a protocol modification allowed the option of a shorter
12-week chemotherapy duration (6-week NAC 1 6-week
AC v 12-week AC) in lower-risk or older patients.

The eligibility criteria included biopsy-confirmed colon can-
cer, CT-predicted T3-4 with extramural extension $ 5 mm
(modified to$ 1 mm after the pilot phase), M0, and being fit
for both surgery and chemotherapy. Patients with bowel
obstruction were eligible if first defunctioned with a stoma.

Treatment allocations were done by telephone or internet,
using a minimized random assignment procedure bal-
ancing for age, CT-predicted T stage and N stage (T3/T4;
Nx/N0/N1/N2), site of tumor, chosen chemotherapy
(oxaliplatin-fluorouracil [OxFU]/OxCap), and defunctioning
colostomy (yes/no).

National and institutional approvals were obtained for the
Protocol (online only). Patients provided written informed
consent. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee
reviewed the accumulating data yearly.

Treatment

OxFU was given using a modified FOLFOX schedule13:
oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 plus l-folinic acid 175 mg 2-hour
infusion, fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 bolus, 2,400 mg/m2

46-hour infusion, repeated once every 2 weeks. A total of
24 (or, optionally, 12) weeks’ treatment was planned (3
NAC cycles1 9 [or 3] AC; or 12 [or 6] AC). Dose reductions,
treatment delays, and early cessation for toxicity were
permissible as in routine practice.

Panitumumab, if allocated, was infused at 6 mg/kg over
30-90minutes before each of the first three cycles of OxFU.
If randomization for panitumumab was not planned,
OxCap18 could be used instead of OxFU: oxaliplatin
130 mg/m2 1-hour IV infusion day 1, then oral capecitabine
1,000 mg/m2 twice a day days 1-14, repeated 3-weekly
(2 cycles NAC 1 6 [or, optionally, 2] AC; or 8 [or 4] AC).

Surgery was scheduled 4-6 weeks after completing NAC or,
for control group patients, as soon as possible after random

CONTEXT

Key Objective
To determine whether giving the first 6 weeks of chemotherapy preoperatively might safely reduce recurrence risk in

patients with locally advanced but operable colon cancer.
Knowledge Generated
Neoadjuvant oxaliplatin-fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy for radiologically selected locally advanced operable colon cancer

can be delivered safely and results in marked tumor down-staging, increased complete resection rates, and better
disease control at 2 years than the same chemotherapy given postoperatively. Histologic tumor regression correlates
strongly with freedom from recurrence. Less response was seen in mismatch repair (MMR)–deficient than in MMR-
proficient cancers. Panitumumab did not enhance the benefit of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Relevance (A.H. Ko)
A short course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy represents a reasonable treatment option for patients with clinical stage

T31 operable, MMR-proficient colon cancer. However, further study and validation are required before adopting this as
the preferred standard of care over up-front surgical resection.*

assignment. AC was scheduled to start 6-10 weeks after
surgery regardless of the histologic stage at resection.
Despite this intent, if chemotherapy was not given, reasons
for its omission were recorded. Clinical follow-up was
according to routine practice except that, to identify any
recurrent disease for the primary outcome, a full clinical
assessment (including carcinoembryonic antigen and a
pelvis/thorax/abdomen CT scan) at 2 years after random
assignment was mandatory. Six-monthly carcinoembryonic
antigen and yearly abdominal CT scans were recom-
mended for the first 3 years.

Radiologic and Pathologic Staging

Lead histopathologists, radiologists, surgeons, and oncol-
ogists were appointed at each center. Radiology and his-
topathology training sessions were held, reaching over 300
consultants. Analyses are based on local radiologists’ and
histopathologists’ reports, with an additional central review
of regression grade, blinded to treatment allocation and
outcome.

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was residual or recurrent disease
within 2 years from random assignment. This was chosen to
maximize statistical power, as chemotherapy effects on
recurrence are concentrated in this period.19 Residual
disease was defined as no resection, or macrosocopic
incomplete resection (ie, residual tumor or metastases)
after surgery but did not include those classified as R1 or
R2 on pathologic review. To avoid lead-time bias, patients
who did not have curative resections were classified as
having the residual disease on day one after random as-
signment. Short-term efficacy was assessed by the rate of
complete resection (R0) versus incomplete (R1, R2) or no
resection, pathologic tumor, nodes, metastases stage
(version 5), extramural venous invasion (EMVI), depth of
invasion beyond muscularis propria, and Dworak tumor
regression grade.20 The primary outcome for the pan-
itumumab subrandomization was the depth of extramural
spread. Adverse effects of chemotherapy (CTCAE V3.0)
and perioperative morbidity were recorded on case record
forms. Recurrence and survival status was updated an-
nually. In addition, dates and causes of death were ob-
tained through national registries.

Statistical Methods

FOxTROT aimed to randomly assign 1,050 patients to
detect a 25% proportional reduction in 2-year recurrence
with NAC (eg, 32% reduced to 24%) with 80% power at
P, .05. Log-rank, intention-to-treat analyses, including all
randomly assigned patients and ignoring panitumumab
allocation, were used to assess the statistical significance of
differences in event rates. Some of the scheduled 2-year
after random assignment scans were done later than 2
years, and it was assumed that recurrences (12 NAC,
six control) detected on late (median 26 [IQR, 8-70] days
later) scans would have been detected if the scan had been

undertaken on day 730 as scheduled. Results with and
without this assumption were similar (Data Supplement,
online only). Deaths from noncolorectal cancer causes
without recorded recurrence were treated as censoring
events, ie, not counted as primary outcomes. T tests and
Mantel-Haenszel tests of association used SAS 9.4 software
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Planned subgroup analyses were
of NAC efficacy by randomization stratification variables
and by biomarkers potentially predictive of treatment
efficacy.

RESULTS

Characteristics of the Patients

Between May 15, 2008, and December 23, 2016, 1,053
(41%) of 2,591 potentially eligible patients were randomly
assigned 2:1 to the NAC group (n 5 699) or control group
(n 5 354), from 85 centers: 79 in the the United Kingdom
(n5 949), three in Denmark (n5 88), and three in Sweden
(n 5 16). Baseline characteristics were balanced across
groups (Data Supplement). Chosen chemotherapy was
OxFU in 756 (72%), OxCap in 297 (28%); the planned total
chemotherapy duration was 24 weeks in 992 (94%), and
12 weeks in 61 (6%). A total of 279 patients participated in
the NAC 6 panitumumab subrandomization. The median
age was 63 years; baseline CT suggested T4 disease in 268
(25%) and lymph-node involvement in 792 (75%). The
median follow-up was 3.1 (IQR, 2.5-4.9) years.

Treatment Delivery

Nine patients (eight NAC, one control) withdrew immedi-
ately after random assignment, providing no trial-specific
follow-up. Of 691 allocated to NAC who provided clinical
follow-up (Fig 1), 674 (97.5%) started NAC, at a median of
11 (IQR, 7-14) days after random assignment, and 606
(90%) completed the full 6-week course (Data Supple-
ment); of 17 (2.5%) who did not start NAC, seven received
AC, so 681 of 691 (98.6%) received chemotherapy at some
point in their treatment. In total, 30 of 691 (4.3%) patients
allocated to NAC developed symptoms of obstruction be-
fore, during, or after receiving NAC, of whom one died of
stroke and 29 underwent primary tumor resection (five after
stenting). Two NAC patients withdrew after chemotherapy
and three died beforehand, so 686 of 689 (99.6%) patients
with follow-up went for surgery. Of 354 control patients, one
withdrew, two died before surgery, and 351 (99.2%) went
for surgery at a median of 14 days (IQR, 9.0-20.0) after
random assignment.

Tolerability

There were, if anything, fewer serious perioperative com-
plications after NAC than after immediate surgery (Table 1);
fewer had anastomotic leaks or abdominal abscesses:
4.7% (32/682) versus 7.4% (26/350), P 5 .072. Fewer
required emergency reoperation (4.3% [29] v 7.1% [25],
P 5 .050), or suffered complications prolonging hospital
stay: 11.6% (79) versus 14.3% (50), P5 .21. Fewer deaths

from noncolon cancer causes without recorded recurrence
occurred within 2 years from random assignment: 4 (0.6%)
of 699 NAC patients compared with 6 (1.7%) of 354 control
patients (P5 .076) (Data Supplement). Toxicities reported
during NAC or AC were those expected with OxFU and
OxCap chemotherapy (Data Supplement).

Histopathologic Outcomes

Substantial reductions in T stage, N stage, and EMVI were
seen in the NAC group, compared with controls (Data
Supplement). Notably, T4 disease was reduced from 107
of 351 (31%) in the control group to 142 of 686 (21%)
after NAC, P , .001. More NAC than control patients
had histopathologically complete (R0) resections: 94%
(648/686) versus 89% (311/351), P , .001. Incomplete
resection (R1, R2, or residual metastases) was reduced:
5.1% (35/686) compared with 10.3% (36/351), as was the
risk of undergoing surgery with no attempted resection:
0.3% (2/686) versus 1.1% (4/351) (Data Supplement).
Patients allocated to NAC also had significant reductions in
a range of other measures of tumor dimension and nodal
invasion, in particular, tumor regression grading: complete
regression in 24 (4%), with marked, moderate, or mild

regression in a further 412 (62%) patients. By contrast,
82% (273) allocated to control were scored by the central
blinded review as showing no evidence of regression:
Figure 2A and Data Supplement.

Of 351 control patients undergoing surgery, 83 (24%) did
not meet standard criteria for AC out-with the trial21: nine
were stage I (T# 2, N0, M0), and 74 were low-risk stage II
(T3, N0, M0, EMVI-negative, not high tumor grade or
budding): Data Supplement.

Postoperative Chemotherapy

Despite postoperative AC being recommended regardless
of histology, AC was started more often in the NAC
(584/686 [85%]) than control group (260/351 [74%]), at
median postoperative intervals of 49 (IQR, 41-56) days and
48 (IQR, 42-56) days, respectively. In patients with histo-
logically high-risk tumors (node-positive, T4 or EMVI),
uptake of chemotherapy was similar in the NAC and control
groups: 88% (344/390) versus 88% (223/253), P 5 .98.
By contrast, patients with low-risk histology were much
more likely to start AC if allocated to NAC than control (81%
[240/296] v39%[37/94],P, .0001,Data Supplement). There

were five recurrences within 2 years among the 57 control
patients with low-risk histology who did not receive AC.

Recurrence and Survival

The primary outcome, residual or recurrent disease within 2
years, occurred less often in NAC group patients: 16.9%
(118/699) NAC versus 21.5% (76/354) control. This cor-
responded to a 28% lower recurrence rate with NAC than
control: rate ratio (RR) 5 0.72 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.98,
P 5 .037, Fig 3). The proportional reductions in colon
cancer–specific mortality (RR 5 0.74 [95% CI, 0.52 to
1.05, P5 .095]), and all-cause mortality (RR5 0.76 [95%
CI, 0.55 to 1.06, P 5 .104]) were of similar magnitude but
did not reach statistical significance. There was no differ-
ence in death from noncolon cancer causes: 19 (2.7%) of
699 neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) patients compared
with 9 (2.5%) of 354 control patients (P 5 .87).

Risk of recurrence was strongly related to histologic re-
gression grade (Fig 2B): 5-year recurrence was 30% for
those with no regression, falling progressively to 22% in
mild, 13% inmoderate, 7% inmarked, and 0% in complete
regression categories. Conversely, in the control group (not

receiving NAC), the recurrence rate for the few tumors with
a histologic appearance scored as mild (58/333 [17%]) or
moderate (2/333 [1%]) regression was, if anything, higher
than in tumors with no regression (RR 5 1.66 [95% CI,
0.91 to 3.03], P 5 .102, Fig 2C).

Panitumumab

There was no indication that panitumumab enhanced the
efficacy of NAC in RAS-wt patients: depth of extramural
invasion was similar with versus without panitumumab: 6.2
versus 7.2 mm, P 5 .48. Seventeen percent (23/137)
NAC 1 panitumumab versus 23% (30/133) NAC alone
showed moderate or greater primary tumor regression
(Data Supplement). The 2-year risk of residual or recurrent
disease did not differ significantly: 18 versus 24 events;
RR 5 0.67 (95% CI, 0.36 to 1.23), P 5 .19, Data
Supplement.

Subgroup Analyses

There was limited statistical power to investigate hetero-
geneity between subgroups in the effect of NAC on 2-year
recurrence (Data Supplement). The more highly powered
comparison of tumor regression rates within subgroups

(Data Supplement) showed similar efficacy of NAC in dif-
ferent radiologic T and N stages, left- and right-sided tu-
mors, age groups, sexes, with OxCap and OxFU, with
shorter or longer proposed treatment duration, whether
RAS-wt or mutant, and whether or not randomly assigned
for panitumumab. The only strong association seen was
with mismatch repair (MMR) status: moderate or greater
regression after NAC was seen in just 7% (8/115) of MMR-
deficient (dMMR) compared with 23% (128/553) of MMR-
proficient (pMMR) tumors (P , .001): Figure 4A and Data
Supplement. Similarly, there was no apparent reduction in
2-year disease recurrence in NAC patients with dMMR
tumors (RR 5 0.86 [0.42 to 1.76], P 5 .68), whereas, in
pMMR tumors, the reduction in 2-year recurrence was
significant: RR5 0.69 (0.50 to 0.97), P5 .043: Figure 4. A
similar pattern was seen for deaths from colon cancer (Data
Supplement).

DISCUSSION

FOxTROT is, to our knowledge, the first phase III trial
evaluating NAC in operable colon cancer. It shows that
short-course (6-week) NAC can be delivered safely and
produces substantial tumor regression and downstaging,
reducing the likelihood of incomplete resection. The
primary objective—to detect a reduction in residual or
recurrent disease within 2 years—was achieved, with a
28% lower event rate with NAC than AC. Chemotherapy
toxicity was similar whether given before or after surgery,
and surgical complications were, if anything, less in the
NAC group.

FOxTROT results indicate that NAC then AC may be su-
perior to conventional postoperative chemotherapy. Cur-
rent clinical guidelines recommend preoperative
chemotherapy as an option only for cT4 colon cancer
because of low-quality evidence.2,22 It is therefore espe-
cially important to scrutinize the validity of the FOxTROT
findings, and what guidance these provide for those con-
sidering implementing NAC.

Perhaps the first question is whether the observed re-
duction in 2-year residual or recurrent disease is sufficient
to support a change in practice. This primary outcome was
chosen because chemotherapy effects on recurrence are
concentrated in the first 2 years,19 so we anticipated that
any greater efficacy of NAC over AC would also be seen in
this period, and this was precisely what we found. Also,
most postoperative therapies that reduce early colorectal
cancer recurrence also improve long-term survival.19,23,24

Hence, 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) is accepted as a
basis to change practice. Unlike DFS, deaths from causes
unrelated to cancer were not included in our primary
outcome as, with both groups receiving chemotherapy,
similar numbers were anticipated. Such deaths provide an
important safety signal but are not a measure of efficacy.25

There were just 10 within 2 years and, reassuringly, fewer in
the NAC than control group. So, had we used DFS rather

than 2-year recurrence as primary outcome, the results
would have been similar: RR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.93;
P 5 .014 (Data Supplement). So, also, would a crude
comparison of proportions of patients disease-free at the
2-year time point (82.5% [577/699] NAC v 76.8%
[272/354] control, P 5 .027).

FOxTROT was not powered to detect differences in overall
recurrence, cancer-specific survival, and overall survival,
though the proportional reductions in these longer-term
outcomes were of similar magnitude and add to the clinical
relevance of the reduction in 2-year recurrence. Longer
follow-up of FOxTROT and meta-analysis with more recent
studies26-28 may help determine whether these outcomes
are also improved.

Another question is whether the observed effect might be
attributable to less complete compliance in the control
than NAC group. FOxTROT was designed to compare the
same total quantity of chemotherapy in the two arms;
however, 98% allocated to NAC started chemotherapy,
whereas 25% of controls did not receive any chemo-
therapy. Most, predictably, had low-risk tumors of whom
only five recurred within 2 years. Had they received
chemotherapy, we estimate that one recurrence might
have been prevented, which would make no material
difference to the study findings. Hence, poor compliance
with AC in lower-risk patients cannot account for the
overall trial result.

The main disadvantage of NAC is that some patients
with radiologically misclassified low-risk tumors receive
unnecessary chemotherapy. In FOxTROT, 24% of con-
trol patients were found to have T3, N0 tumors without
additional risk factors. For such patients whose recur-
rence risk is low, chemotherapy benefits are usually
considered insufficient to justify the toxicity.21 Our on-
going review of FOxTROT radiology, and advances in
radiologic techniques,29 should help improve the risk
stratification algorithm for the deselection of patients with
these lowest-risk cancers.

It should also be noted that overtreatment occurs with
adjuvant chemotherapy as well as NAC: even for high-risk
operable colon cancer, around 10 patients are treated to
prevent one recurrence. Regression grade after NAC might
be useful in identifying which patients do and do not benefit
from chemotherapy. For example, AC may not be needed
for those with marked histologic regression after NAC who
have a low risk of subsequent recurrence. This would need
rigorous evaluation since it is also possible that patients with
an excellent response to NAC are those who would benefit
most from postoperative AC. Only randomized trials, per-
haps incorporating circulating tumor DNA monitoring, can
resolve these uncertainties.

Interestingly, apparent regression was associated with
worse outcomes in control group patients. This may be
because appearances similar to those associated with

Preoperative Chemotherapy for Operable Colon Cancer



response to NAC are, in untreated patients, instead, in-
dicative of high tumor stromal content, a poor prognostic
feature.30 Since histologic regression is only prognostic after
NAC, it must be an indicator of chemosensitivity, and not
simply a surrogate for innately better-prognosis tumors.
Hence, regression may reflect the effect of chemotherapy
not just on the primary tumor but also on distant micro-
metastases and, consequently, long-term oncologic out-
comes. This makes regression grade a potentially useful
surrogate end point for future trials that might allow a more
rapid assessment of novel NAC schedules.

FOxTROT, when launched in 2008, did not prespecify that
lesser benefit was expected in dMMR tumors; however,
dMMR has since been reported to predict nonbenefit from
adjuvant fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy in colon cancer,31

and from NAC in gastroesophageal cancer.32 Consistent
with these studies, tumor regression was far less common
in dMMR than pMMR tumors, although four pathologic
complete regressions were seen. No reduction in recur-
rence was seen in patients with dMMR tumors. FOxTROT
has demonstrated the feasibility of rapid KRAS testing
before the panitumumab random assignment, and clini-
cians considering using NAC could implement rapid MMR
assessment of diagnostic biopsies to exclude dMMR pa-
tients for whom neoadjuvant immunotherapy seems amore
promising option.33

We chose a short, 6-week neoadjuvant treatment to reduce
the risk of toxicity impairing surgical fitness, and chemo-
resistant cancers progressing to inoperability. This choice
appears justified: NAC was well tolerated, with high com-
pletion rates. Surgical morbidity appeared lower rather than

higher, which may be due to tumor downsizing after NAC.
Despite the fact that one third of NAC patients showed no
discernible histologic regression, only 4% developed ob-
structive symptoms requiring expedited surgery, and all but
one who did so were still able to undergo successful primary
cancer resection. Therefore, pending randomized trials to
explore longer durations, a 6-week NAC treatment remains
our recommendation.

Over 80 hospitals took part in FOxTROT indicating that
the results of this real world trial are generalizable to
clinical practice. The median age of patients was 63,
somewhat younger than in an unselected colon cancer
population, but similar to that in pivotal AC trials. Just 28%
(292/1,052) were aged over 70 years, compared with
about 50% of incident cases, so they are likely to rep-
resent a fitter subset of older patients. However, it is still
notable that they benefited at least as much from NAC as
the younger patients.

In summary, patients with locally advanced but resectable
colon cancer, selected using standard CT, may safely
undergo 6 weeks of NAC before colon resection and then
completion of AC. This does not increase perioperative
morbidity, substantial tumor regression is achieved, and
disease control is significantly better at 2 years than with the
same chemotherapy given entirely postoperatively. NAC,
like AC, is of less certain benefit in dMMR than pMMR
cancers. Tumor regression after NAC is a strong predictor of
lower postoperative recurrence risk and may provide a
useful guide for later treatment. Six weeks of NAC should be
considered as a treatment option for patients with locally
advanced colon cancer.
