Abstract 

Background Colorectal cancer stands as a prevalent cause of cancer‑related mortality, necessitating effective 
treatment strategies. Acute colonic obstruction occurs in approximately 20% of patients and represents a surgical 
emergency with substantial morbidity and mortality. The optimal approach for managing left‑sided colon cancer 
with acute colonic obstruction remains debatable, with no consensus on whether emergency resection or bridge‑to‑
surgery, involving initial decompressing stoma and subsequent elective resection after recovery, should be employed. 
Current studies show a decrease in morbidity and short‑term mortality for the bridge‑to‑surgery approach, yet it 
remains unclear if the long‑term oncological outcome is equivalent to emergency resection.

Methods This prospective, randomized, multicenter trial aims to investigate the management of obstructive left‑
sided colon cancer in a comprehensive manner. The study will be conducted across 26 university hospitals and 40 
academic hospitals in Germany. A total of 468 patients will be enrolled, providing a cohort of 420 evaluable patients, 
with an equal distribution of 210 patients in each treatment arm. Patients with left‑sided colon cancer, defined as can‑
cer between the left splenic flexure and > 12 cm ab ano and obstruction confirmed by X‑ray or CT scan, are eligible. 
Randomization will be performed in a 1:1 ratio, assigning patients either to the oncological emergency resection 
group or the bridge‑to‑surgery group, wherein patients will undergo diverting stoma and subsequent elective onco‑
logical resection after recovery. The primary endpoint of this trial will be 120‑day mortality, allowing for consideration 
of the time interval between diverting stoma and resection.

Discussion The findings derived from this trial possess the potential to reshape the current clinical approach 
of emergency resection for obstructive left‑sided colon cancer by favoring the bridge‑to‑surgery practice, provided 
that a reduction in morbidity can be achieved without compromising the oncological long‑term outcome.

Introduction
Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer 
death in both men and women in the USA [1] and the 
second leading cause of cancer death in men and the 
third leading cause of cancer death in women in Europe 
[2]. Worldwide, colorectal cancer accounts for 19.0 mil-
lion (18.5–19.5) disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) [3]. 
The risk of developing colorectal cancer increases with 
age. More than half of patients develop the disease after 
the age of 70; only about 10% of cancers occur before the 
age of 55. Approximately 20% of patients initially present 
with acute colonic obstruction, which represents one of 
the most common causes of surgical emergency [4, 5]. 
While the consensus for right-sided obstructive colon 
cancer is primary resection and ileocolic anastomosis 
[6], international guidelines do not agree on the opti-
mal management of the much more common left-sided 
obstructive colon cancer [4]. The most recommended 
procedure for patients with left-sided obstructive colon 
cancer is the emergency resection (ER) with or without 
anastomosis, which is a risk factor for high morbidity and 
mortality [5, 7].

A study evaluating the Dutch surgical colorectal audit 
data between 2009 and 2013 found an overall mortality of 
8.5% after emergency resection compared to 3.4% in elec-
tive surgery [5]. Furthermore, primary anastomosis was 
only achieved in 64% of emergency resections, with 5% 
end ileostomy and 21% end colostomy compared to over 
90% primary anastomosis in elective surgery [8].

A major burden for patients after emergency colon 
cancer resection is the development of postoperative 
complications, prolonged intensive care unit stay, per-
manent stoma, and in-hospital death. Patients undergo-
ing emergency resection for obstructive cancer have a 
significant risk of permanent stoma [8, 9] and up to 70% 
of stoma patients experience long-term dysfunction or 
complications that significantly reduce their quality of life 
[3, 10]. Finally, the socioeconomic burden of colon can-
cer must be considered, as the cost of care has increased 
significantly in recent years. Currently, 31% of costs are 
spent on complications, with a 196% increase in costs for 
patients with major complications [11]. Reducing mortal-
ity and morbidity after emergency resection for obstruc-
tive left-sided colon cancer could significantly reduce 
costs to the healthcare costs [12, 13].

Several studies have suggested two-staged approaches 
with primary bowel decompression, either through 
the use of self-expanding metallic stents (SEMS) or 

placement of a decompressing stoma (DS) as a bridge-
to-surgery (BTS). This approach aims to relieve colonic 
obstruction and allows patients to undergo elective onco-
logical hemicolectomy after recovery. The BTS approach 
is considered a feasible and safe alternative to emergency 
resection with the goal of reducing postoperative compli-
cations [7]. Previous studies have mainly focused on com-
paring SEMS versus emergency resection in obstructive 
left colon cancer. A recent representative meta-analysis 
by Jain et al. concludes that SEMS offers several advan-
tages over emergency resection, including significantly 
lower rates of permanent stomas, decreased anastomotic 
leakage, and improved overall in-hospital mortality [7]. 
However, the placement of SEMS requires a high level of 
endoscopic expertise that may not be available in all hos-
pitals. Moreover, there is still a lack of evidence regarding 
the oncological risks associated with microperforations 
during stenting. Several studies have suggested a poten-
tial increase in locoregional recurrence rates [14]. Con-
versely, the BTS approach, involving the placement of a 
decompressing stoma, presents a technically straightfor-
ward procedure that can be performed minimally inva-
sively and universally in emergency scenarios [15].

To date, only one randomized study has compared the 
use of a decompressing stoma as a bridge to surgery with 
emergency resection. Despite the study’s limitations, 
including a small patient cohort (n = 121), an extended 
inclusion period (1978–1993), and the absence of mini-
mally invasive techniques, Kronborg et  al. observed a 
significant decrease in the incidence of permanent colos-
tomies and a non-significant trend towards lower mor-
bidity among patients undergoing a two-staged approach 
with a decompressing stoma [16].

A meta-analysis from 2015 summarizes the findings 
of eight comparative studies involving 2424 patients 
from 1977 to 2015 [17]. While the meta-analysis did not 
identify significant differences in 30-day mortality and 
morbidity between the treatment groups, patients who 
received a decompressing stoma before elective resection 
were more likely to undergo primary anastomoses and 
less likely to be left with a permanent stoma [17].

A recent retrospective propensity-score matched 
study by Veld, Tanis et  al. demonstrated that the use of 
a decompressing stoma as part of the BTS approach 
resulted in a significantly decreased 90-day mortality 
rate compared to emergency resection (1.7% vs. 7.2%, 
p = 0.006) [18]. This difference was particularly pro-
nounced in the patients over 70  years of age (3.5% vs. 



Page 3 of 9Pecqueux et al. Trials           (2023) 24:641 

13.7%, p = 0.027). Additionally, patients treated with a 
decompressing stoma underwent a higher proportion of 
minimally invasive resections (56.8% vs. 9.2%, p < 0.001) 
and had a greater incidence of primary anastomoses 
(88.5% vs. 40.7%, p < 0.001), a reduced occurrence of per-
manent stomas (23.4% vs. 42.4%, p < 0.001), and improved 
3-year overall survival rates (79.4% vs. 73.3%, hazard ratio 
0.36) [18].

These findings collectively suggest that the BTS 
approach for obstructive left-sided colon cancer has the 
potential to decrease perioperative mortality and improve 
quality of life by reducing the need for permanent stomas 
without compromising long-term oncological outcomes. 
However, it should be noted that the retrospective nature 
of the studies mentioned above precludes a comprehen-
sive evaluation of dropout rates between decompress-
ing stoma placement and subsequent resection. Thus, a 
prospective randomized trial is necessary to conduct an 
intention-to-treat analysis and validate these findings.

In this randomized multicenter trial, we aim to com-
pare the outcomes of patients with obstructive left-sided 
colon cancer who undergo either emergency resection or 
the placement of a decompressing stoma as a bridge-to-
surgery strategy.

Methods
Ethical approval and study registration
The COMPASS trial has obtained ethical approval from 
the ethical committee of the TU Dresden (Ethical Com-
mittee number EK-278062022). Furthermore, the trial 
has been registered on the 15 May 2023 in the German 
Clinical Trials Register (DRKS) under the identifier 
DRKS00031827 (https:// drks. de/ search/ en/ trial/ DRKS0 
00318 27).

Study design
The COMPASS trial is a multicenter, randomized, open-
label study that will be conducted across 26 university 
hospitals and 40 academic hospitals in Germany. The 
trial was designed to show the superiority in regard to 
120-day postoperative mortality among patients sub-
jected to a two-stage bridge-to-surgery (BTS) procedure, 
as opposed to those undergoing a single-stage emergency 
resection (ER) for the management of obstructive left-
sided colon cancer. Inclusion criteria involve patients 
presenting with symptoms of obstruction (abdominal 
distension, nausea, and/or vomiting) and having a left-
sided colon tumor suspected of being colon cancer. Radi-
ological assessments, including X-ray or a CT scan, must 
demonstrate a dilated colon with or without dilatation of 
the small intestine. Additionally, a high-grade suspicion 
of colon cancer should be identified on CT or endoscopy 

during the preoperative examination. Please refer to 
Fig. 1 for an illustration of the trial scheme.

Stratification and randomization
Patient randomization will be performed using a secure 
online computer randomization system, either directly 
in the operating room or by the trial coordinator via 
phone. Block randomization will be employed to ensure 
balanced participant numbers throughout the trial. 
Stratification will be applied based on the following fac-
tors: age (younger or older than 70  years), tumor stage, 
gender, ASA classification (1–2 vs. 3), presence of small 
bowel distention, and study center. Randomization must 
be completed within 24 h of study enrollment. Treatment 
allocation will not be concealed from patients, physi-
cians, or researchers at any point during the trial.

After obtaining preoperative informed consent, 
patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the 
trial. The choice of the surgical technique (minimally 
invasive vs. open) and the method of reconstruction (pri-
mary anastomosis or discontinuous resection) during 
tumor resection, as well as the type of stoma (loop ileos-
tomy, loop colostomy or cecal fistula) in the bridge-to-
surgery group is at the discretion of the surgeon.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Inclusion criteria:

(from the splenic flexure to the intraperitoneal rec-
tum with the tumor located more than 12 cm from 
the anal verge) undergoing curative treatment

unilateral lobectomy for curative purposes without 
infiltration of the main bronchus or central pulmo-
nary artery/vein

Intervention
The aim of the current study is to compare two surgi-
cal approaches for the resection of left-sided obstruc-
tive colon cancer: the single-stage emergency resection 
(control group) and the two-stage bridge-to-surgery pro-
cedure (intervention group). Both groups will undergo 
curative hemicolectomy, including tumor resection and 
lymph node dissection. International guidelines provide 
varying recommendations, with 42% advocating emer-
gency surgery and 47% suggesting either emergency sur-
gery or stenting as bridge-to-surgery. Primary resection 
with or without anastomosis is the most commonly rec-
ommended procedure [5]. Accordingly, emergency resec-
tion is currently the most frequently performed approach 
in many countries [19]. Retrospective studies have indi-
cated that the two-stage approach with decompress-
ing stoma can reduce 90-day mortality from 7.2 to 1.7% 
and the incidence of permanent stomas from 42 to 23% 
compared to the control group [18]. Considering these 
factors, we have determined the one-stage approach 
with emergency resection of the tumor to be the control 
group, reflecting the prevailing practice. Conversely, the 
two-stage procedure with decompression of the colon 
before elective surgery, as recommended by some guide-
lines, is assigned as the intervention group.

While the BTS approach can improve the patient’s gen-
eral condition during resection, it also prolongs the time-
to-surgery (TTS). Prolonged TTS may have an impact 
on cancer survival. Studies by Satish et  al. and Kalten-
meier et al. have presented conflicting results, with Sat-
ish et al. suggesting that extended TTS (> 21–30 days) is 
associated with a lower adjusted risk of death [20], while 

Kaltenmeier et al. found that prolonged TTS is associated 
with an increased risk of death [21].

To address this potential issue, our study design incor-
porates TTS as a secondary end point and evaluate its 
association with cancer-specific factors, such as cancer 
survival.

Control group (emergency resection arm)
In the control group, patients will undergo a single-stage 
oncological left-sided hemicolectomy with the option of 
a primary anastomosis with or without loop ileostomy or 
a Hartmann’s procedure (closure of the colorectal stump 
and end colostomy).

Intervention group (decompressing stoma 
as bridge‑to‑surgery arm)
In the intervention group, patients will undergo a two-
stage resection with a decompressing stoma procedure. 
After a period of convalescence, an elective, oncologic left 
hemicolectomy will be performed. The stoma technique 
during the first procedure can be performed as either 
loop or blowhole colostomy (a loop ileostomy is also pos-
sible if deemed adequate), while the elective resection 
can be conducted as a primary anastomosis with or with-
out loop ileostomy or a Hartmann’s procedure. The time 
interval between the decompressing stoma and resec-
tion will be determined by the treating surgeon, with an 
expected period of approximately 30 days based on cur-
rent studies [18, 22].

Any additional concurrent care, including the use of 
adjuvant therapy after resection, is left to the discretion 
of the treating physicians.

Endpoints of the study
The study has identified several primary and secondary 
outcomes to evaluate the effectiveness and impact of the 
two surgical approaches for left-sided obstructive colon 
cancer. The primary outcome focuses on perioperative 
mortality within a 120-day period after surgery. Usu-
ally, perioperative death is defined as mortality within 
90  days after surgery, but to compensate for the delay 
between decompressing stoma placement and tumor 
resection in the intervention group, we opted to extend 
the primary endpoint by 30  days according to recent 
studies [14, 18, 22].

Primary outcome:

– Perioperative 120-day mortality

Control group: mortality within 120 days after emer-
gency resection



Page 6 of 9Pecqueux et al. Trials           (2023) 24:641 

Intervention group: mortality within 120  days after 
decompressing stoma placement

Secondary outcomes:

1. Quality of life
2. Permanent Stoma rate
3. Stoma-associated complications
4. Quality-adjusted survival (QALY)
5. Number of resected lymph nodes
6. Number of R0 resections
7. 3-year overall survival
8. 3-year cancer-specific survival
9. 3-year disease-free survival

The secondary endpoints were developed in collabora-
tion with experts as well as patient groups, such as the 
German ILCO, to ensure a comprehensive assessment of 
patient outcomes, including quality of life, complications, 
the rate of permanent stomas, and cancer-related factors.

Statistics
The statistical analysis plan for the study involves vari-
ous tests and methods to analyze different endpoints. 
The chi-squared test will be applied to compare the 
perioperative 120-day mortality between the control and 
intervention arms using an intent-to-treat analysis. The 
significance levels were set to 5% (two-sided). The sec-
ondary endpoints will each be analyzed accordingly: The 
rate of primary anastomoses, permanent stomas, and 
120-day complication rate will be investigated using the 
chi-square test. The 3-year overall survival will be exam-
ined using the Kaplan-Meyer estimator combined with 
the log-rank test. The treatment effect on the patient-
reported quality of life will be analyzed using a regression 
analysis. Quality-adjusted survival will be analyzed using 
marginal models and non-parametric regression.

The statistical significance of stratification factors will 
be assessed. Propensity score matching may be used as a 
part of a supplementary analysis, to control for potential 
confounding factors that were not accounted for dur-
ing sampling. In particular, a propensity score matching 
procedure with age as a continuous variable may be used 
to control for between-arm age differences. Statistical 
analyses of matched-sub-cohorts will have an exploratory 
character, providing additional information about effect 
sizes. The standardized mean differences and confidence 
intervals will be reported, and p-values will be provided 
as an additional information.

Sample size calculations
The sample size calculation was performed using an 
estimated 120-day mortality rates of 8% and 1.7% in the 

control and intervention arms, respectively. These rates 
were extrapolated from the 90-day mortality rates of 1.7% 
(decompressing stoma (DS)) vs 7.2% (emergency resec-
tion (ER)) as well as the 3-year overall survival data in the 
propensity-score matched study by Veld, Tanis et al. [18]. 
The effect size was then reduced with an assumed 120-
day mortality rate of 1.7% for the decompressing stoma 
group and 7% in the emergency resection group, result-
ing in a reduced effect size of 0.274 and an increased rela-
tive risk of 0.243.

To achieve the 80% power with a (two-sided) 5% signif-
icance level using a normal curve via arcsine transforma-
tion (Cohen, 1988, Chapter  6), at least 210 patients per 
arm (total 420 patients) need to be analyzed. To account 
for an expected 10% dropout rate, the target enrollment 
is 468 patients (234 per arm). Considering a 20% screen-
failure rate, 588 patients will need to be assessed for eligi-
bility. The power calculations were performed using SAS 
Version 9.4.

Methods against bias
To address potential bias and ensure the integrity of the 
study, several methods have been implemented. As men-
tioned above, randomization and stratification will be 
used to allocate patients into the control and intervention 
groups. This process will be conducted using a secure 
online computer randomization system and will consider 
factors such as age, tumor stage, gender, ASA classifica-
tion, presence of small bowel distention, and study center. 
By stratifying these variables, a balanced distribution can 
be achieved, reducing the risk of bias. To account for 
the delay between decompressing stoma placement and 
tumor resection in the intervention group, the primary 
endpoint of perioperative mortality has been adjusted to 
120-day. This extension allows for a comprehensive eval-
uation of mortality rates in both groups with an appro-
priate timeframe.

The primary endpoint will be analyzed using the inten-
tion-to-treat (ITT) principle, and the final study report, 
in line with transparent reporting standards, will adhere 
to the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting 
Trials) statement.

Feasibility of the recruitment
Based on the estimated incidence of acute large bowel 
obstruction in Germany, it is anticipated that approxi-
mately 2500–5000 patients per year would be eligible 
for the study [4, 5]. In our own Department of Surgery, 
approx. 15–20 patients/year present with a left-sided 
obstructive colon cancer. We estimate that our center 
could include around 10 patients per year into the study. 
Based on these data and the retrospective Dutch trial by 
Veld, Tanis et al. [18], we estimate that a minimum of 35 



Page 7 of 9Pecqueux et al. Trials           (2023) 24:641 

large centers are needed to achieve the required sample 
size. Currently, 66 hospitals have committed to partici-
pate in the trial. The participating centers were selected 
according to recruitment potential, existing trial infra-
structure and medical experience. To ensure adequate 
representation across different levels of care, basic care 
hospitals, and hospitals of the regular and priority care as 
well as maximum care hospitals such as university hospi-
tals will be included in the recruitment.

Oversight and monitoring
The study’s regulatory and supervisory functions are 
managed by the principal investigator (PI) in conjunction 
with the Coordination Centre for Clinical Trials (KKS) 
Dresden. The KKS Dresden assumes the data monitor-
ing, which will follow a risk-based approach in line with 
the ICH-GCP (R2) guidelines. This includes assessing 
feasibility, availability and completeness of study mate-
rial, ethics committee approvals, and providing adequate 
training to local staff. Monitoring activities will also ver-
ify written consent forms, source data, and accurate data 
entries. The frequency of monitoring will be determined 
based on the assessed risk to maintain data quality and 
study integrity. A patient advisory council board, com-
prised of individuals affiliated with the patient self-help 
organization ILCO, will offer invaluable support to the 
principal investigator (PI) and the coordinating center 
by contributing their personal expertise and experience 

when confronted with challenges that emerge through-
out the course of the clinical trial. By implementing these 
methods, the study aims to minimize bias, ensure rigor-
ous data collection and analysis, and provide a compre-
hensive and reliable evaluation of the chosen surgical 
approaches.

An independent data and safety monitoring board 
(DSMB), comprised of members without conflict of 
interest with the project and study investigators, will con-
duct regular interim analyses to assess the progress of the 
study and examine safety variables. The DSMB can ter-
minate the study for safety reasons or due to early superi-
ority, without predefined definitions.

Data management
Personal health data will be recorded (Table  1) and 
archived by authorized study personnel for a minimum of 
10 years, ensuring privacy by removing identifying infor-
mation. Pseudonymized data will be transmitted to the 
Clinical Study Center for analysis and monitoring, acces-
sible only to authorized personnel bound by confiden-
tiality agreements. Participants have the right to revoke 
their consent for data storage and use, with the option 
for pseudonymized data to be retained unless specifically 
requested for complete deletion. Data entry is performed 
using a study software that complies with the require-
ments of applicable laws and guidelines, particularly 
ICH-GCP. The extent of database access and associated

permissions are regulated through corresponding user 
roles. Data completeness, plausibility, and consistency 
are checked through programmed validations directly in 
the electronic case report form (eCRF) as well as supple-
mentary manual checks outside of the eCRF. Any queries 
arising from these checks are sent directly to the respec-
tive study center within the eCRF. Corrections result-
ing from the responses to these queries are made by the 
study center in the eCRF.

Criteria for discontinuing the study
The following termination rules or criteria are applicable:

1. Individual patient termination: In the event that a patient, 
who has previously undergone a decompressive stoma 
procedure within the intervention group, becomes medi-
cally ineligible for the subsequent two-stage operation, 
their informed consent will be withdrawn.

2. Exclusion of participating investigative centers: 
Investigative centers that deviate from the study pro-
tocol, primarily due to inadequate patient recruit-
ment (less than one per year) and compromised data 
quality, will be excluded from the analysis.

3. Study suspension: The entire study will be temporar-
ily suspended following the occurrence of any of the 
subsequent events until evaluated by the data and 
safety monitoring board (DSMB):

 Elevated incidence of severe morbidity and/or post-
operative mortality observed within either the inter-
vention or control group

 Increased frequency of surgical interventions within 
either the intervention or control group

 Receipt of a recommendation from the DSMB to 
prematurely terminate the study due to participant 
safety concerns in either of the two groups

Protocol changes
Modifications to the study protocol will only be made 
upon obtaining prior approval from the ethical commit-
tee. Any protocol changes will be duly noted on the Ger-
man Clinical Trials Register (DRKS).

Dissemination trial results
The results will be submitted to the German Clinical Trials 
Register (DRKS) and published in a peer reviewed journal. 
Furthermore, the patient group ILCO which was involved in 
defining the primary and secondary endpoints of the study 
will be used to disseminate the results among its members.

Discussion
Colorectal cancer represents the third leading cause 
of cancer death in Europe and the USA. The risk 
increases with age, with more than half of the patients 

diagnosed above the age of 70. Acute colonic obstruc-
tion is a common presentation, accounting for up to 
30% of cases, and represents one of the most com-
mon causes of surgical emergency. While the pre-
ferred treatment for obstructing right-sided colon 
cancers is primary resection with an ileocolic anasto-
mosis, there is a lack of consensus regarding the opti-
mal approach for left sided obstructive colon cancer 
[4], which accounts for two thirds of all colon cancers 
[23]. Primary resection with or without anastomo-
sis is the most recommended procedure according to 
international guidelines, although bridge-to-surgery 
treatment is also considered. Emergency resection car-
ries a higher risk of morbidity and mortality, while the 
bridge-to-surgery approach has the potential for resec-
tion and intermediate metastasis.

A recent large retrospective study utilizing data of the 
Dutch Colorectal Audit (DCRA)—a national mandatory 
registry—suggests that the bridge-to-surgery approach 
can significantly reduce perioperative mortality and per-
manent stoma rates and improve long-term survival in 
patients with left-sided obstructive colon cancer [18]. 
However, retrospective studies have limitations in accu-
rately representing the interval between stoma creation 
and resection. Furthermore, existing prospective stud-
ies are either very outdated [16] or involve a comparison 
between endoscopic stenting and emergency resection 
in a relatively small number of patients [24]. Endoscopic 
stenting in obstructive cancer is technically challeng-
ing with a limited success rate of 78% in highly special-
ized centers. This high level of endoscopic expertise is 
not available in most hospitals where patients with acute 
obstructive colon cancer present themselves. Addition-
ally, concerns regarding microperforations during stent-
ing and their impact on long-term oncological outcomes 
exist. Nevertheless, these studies have shown an increased 
rate of primary anastomoses and a significant reduction in 
permanent stomas.

To address these uncertainties, the present study aims 
to compare the peri- and postoperative outcomes of 
patients with obstructive left-sided colon cancer who 
undergo emergency resection versus those who receive 
decompressing stoma as bridge-to-surgery. The objective 
is to determine the optimal approach for the treatment 
of obstructive left-sided colon cancer and shed light on 
the associated perioperative and long-term outcomes.

Trial status
COMPASS is currently establishing recruitment sites and 
is expecting to begin recruitment in October 2023. The 
current protocol version is 2.0F. The approximate end 
date for recruitment will be October 2026.
