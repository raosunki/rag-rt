BACKGROUND
Vaccines are needed to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and to protect 
persons who are at high risk for complications. The mRNA-1273 vaccine is a lipid 
nanoparticle–encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine that encodes the prefusion stabi-
lized full-length spike protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona-
virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes Covid-19.

METHODS
This phase 3 randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted 
at 99 centers across the United States. Persons at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infec-
tion or its complications were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two intra-
muscular injections of mRNA-1273 (100 μg) or placebo 28 days apart. The pri-
mary end point was prevention of Covid-19 illness with onset at least 14 days after 
the second injection in participants who had not previously been infected with 
SARS-CoV-2.

RESULTS
The trial enrolled 30,420 volunteers who were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive either vaccine or placebo (15,210 participants in each group). More than 
96% of participants received both injections, and 2.2% had evidence (serologic, 
virologic, or both) of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline. Symptomatic Covid-19 ill-
ness was confirmed in 185 participants in the placebo group (56.5 per 1000 person-
years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 48.7 to 65.3) and in 11 participants in the mRNA-
1273 group (3.3 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 1.7 to 6.0); vaccine efficacy was 
94.1% (95% CI, 89.3 to 96.8%; P<0.001). Efficacy was similar across key secondary 
analyses, including assessment 14 days after the first dose, analyses that included 
participants who had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline, and analyses 
in participants 65 years of age or older. Severe Covid-19 occurred in 30 partici-
pants, with one fatality; all 30 were in the placebo group. Moderate, transient re-
actogenicity after vaccination occurred more frequently in the mRNA-1273 group. 
Serious adverse events were rare, and the incidence was similar in the two groups.

CONCLUSIONS
The mRNA-1273 vaccine showed 94.1% efficacy at preventing Covid-19 illness, 
including severe disease. Aside from transient local and systemic reactions, no 
safety concerns were identified. (Funded by the Biomedical Advanced Research 
and Development Authority and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious

The emergence in December 2019 of a 
novel coronavirus, the severe acute respi-
ratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-

CoV-2), has had devastating consequences glob-
ally. Control measures such as the use of masks, 
physical distancing, testing of exposed or symp-
tomatic persons, contact tracing, and isolation 
have helped limit the transmission where they have 
been rigorously applied; however, these actions 
have been variably implemented and have proved 
insufficient in impeding the spread of coronavi-
rus disease 2019 (Covid-19), the disease caused by 
SARS-CoV-2. Vaccines are needed to reduce the 
morbidity and mortality associated with Covid-19, 
and multiple vaccine platforms have been involved 
in the rapid development of vaccine candidates.1-9

The mRNA vaccine platform has advantages 
as a pandemic-response strategy, given its flexi-
bility and efficiency in immunogen design and 
manufacturing. Earlier work had suggested that 
the spike protein of the coronavirus responsible 
for the 2002 SARS outbreak was a suitable target 
for protective immunity.10 Numerous vaccine can-
didates in various stages of development are now 
being evaluated.11-13 Shortly after the SARS-CoV-2 
genetic sequence was determined in January 
2020, mRNA-1273, a lipid-nanoparticle (LNP)–
encapsulated mRNA vaccine expressing the pre-
fusion-stabilized spike glycoprotein, was developed 
by Moderna and the Vaccine Research Center at 
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 
Diseases (NIAID), within the National Institutes 
of Health (NIH).14 The mRNA-1273 vaccine dem-
onstrated protection in animal-challenge experi-
ments15 and encouraging safety and immunoge-
nicity in early-stage human testing.1,4 The efficacy 
and safety of another mRNA vaccine, BNT162b2, 
was recently demonstrated.16

The Coronavirus Efficacy (COVE) phase 3 trial 
was launched in late July 2020 to assess the 
safety and efficacy of the mRNA-1273 vaccine in 
preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. An independent 
data and safety monitoring board determined 
that the vaccine met the prespecified efficacy 
criteria at the first interim analysis. We report the 
primary analysis results of this ongoing pivotal 
phase 3 trial.

Trial Oversight

This phase 3 randomized, stratified, observer-
blinded, placebo-controlled trial enrolled adults 

in medically stable condition at 99 U.S. sites. 
Participants received the first trial injection be-
tween July 27 and October 23, 2020. The trial is 
being conducted in accordance with the Inter-
national Council for Harmonisation of Techni-
cal Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Hu-
man Use, Good Clinical Practice guidelines, 
and applicable government regulations. The cen-
tral institutional review board approved the 
protocol and the consent forms. All partici-
pants provided written informed consent be-
fore enrollment. Safety is reviewed by a protocol 
safety review team weekly and by an indepen-
dent data and safety monitoring board on a 
continual basis. The trial Investigational New 
Drug sponsor, Moderna, was responsible for 
the overall trial design (with input from the 
Biomedical Advanced Research and Develop-
ment Authority, the NIAID, the Covid-19 Pre-
vention Network, and the trial cochairs), site 
selection and monitoring, and data analysis. 
Investigators are responsible for data collection. 
A medical writer funded by Moderna assisted 
in drafting the manuscript for submission. The 
authors vouch for the accuracy and complete-
ness of the data and for the fidelity of the trial 
to the protocol. The trial is ongoing, and the 
investigators remain unaware of participant-
level data. Designated team members within 
Moderna have unblinded access to the data, to 
facilitate interface with the regulatory agencies 
and the data and safety monitoring board; all 
other trial staff and participants remain un-
aware of the treatment assignments.

Participants, Randomization, and Data 
Blinding

Eligible participants were persons 18 years of age 
or older with no known history of SARS-CoV-2 
infection and with locations or circumstances 
that put them at an appreciable risk of SARS-
CoV-2 infection, a high risk of severe Covid-19, 
or both. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are pro-
vided in the protocol (available with the full text 
of this article at NEJM.org). To enhance the di-
versity of the trial population in accordance with 
Food and Drug Administration Draft Guidance, 
site-selection and enrollment processes were 
adjusted to increase the number of persons from 
racial and ethnic minorities in the trial, in addi-
tion to the persons at risk for SARS-CoV-2 infec-
tion in the local population. The upper limit for 
stratification of enrolled participants considered

Efficacy and Safety of mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine

to be “at risk for severe illness” at screening was 
increased from 40% to 50%.17

Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 
ratio, through the use of a centralized interactive 
response technology system, to receive vaccine or 
placebo. Assignment was stratified, on the basis 
of age and Covid-19 complications risk criteria, 
into the following risk groups: persons 65 years 
of age or older, persons younger than 65 years of 
age who were at heightened risk (at risk) for se-
vere Covid-19, and persons younger than 65 years 
of age without heightened risk (not at risk). Par-
ticipants younger than 65 years of age were cate-
gorized as having risk for severe Covid-19 if they 
had at least one of the following risk factors, 
based on the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention (CDC) criteria available at the time of trial 
design: chronic lung disease (e.g., emphysema, 
chronic bronchitis, idiopathic pulmonary fibro-
sis, cystic fibrosis, or moderate-to-severe asthma); 
cardiac disease (e.g., heart failure, congenital 
coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathies, or pul-
monary hypertension); severe obesity (body mass 
index [the weight in kilograms divided by the 
square of the height in meters] ≥40); diabetes 
(type 1, type 2, or gestational); liver disease; or in-
fection with the human immunodeficiency virus.18

Vaccine dose preparation and administration 
were performed by pharmacists and vaccine ad-
ministrators who were aware of treatment as-
signments but had no other role in the conduct 
of the trial. Once the injection was completed, 
only trial staff who were unaware of treatment 
assignments performed assessments and inter-
acted with the participants. Access to the ran-
domization code was strictly controlled at the 
pharmacy. The data and safety monitoring board 
reviewed efficacy data at the group level and 
unblinded safety data at the participant level.

Trial Vaccine

The mRNA-1273 vaccine, provided as a sterile 
liquid at a concentration of 0.2 mg per milliliter, 
was administered by injection into the deltoid 
muscle according to a two-dose regimen. Injec-
tions were given 28 days apart, in the same arm, 
in a volume of 0.5 ml containing 100 μg of 
mRNA-1273 or saline placebo.1 Vaccine mRNA-
1273 was stored at 2° to 8°C (35.6° to 46.4°F) at 
clinical sites before preparation and vaccination. 
No dilution was required. Doses could be held in 
syringes for up to 8 hours at room temperature 
before administration.

Safety Assessments

Safety assessments included monitoring of solic-
ited local and systemic adverse events for 7 days 
after each injection; unsolicited adverse reac-
tions for 28 days after each injection; adverse 
events leading to discontinuation from a dose, 
from participation in the trial, or both; and 
medically attended adverse events and serious 
adverse events from day 1 through day 759. Ad-
verse event grading criteria and toxicity tables 
are described in the protocol. Cases of Covid-19 
and severe Covid-19 were continuously moni-
tored by the data and safety monitoring board 
from randomization onward.

Efficacy Assessments

The primary end point was the efficacy of the 
mRNA-1273 vaccine in preventing a first occur-
rence of symptomatic Covid-19 with onset at 
least 14 days after the second injection in the 
per-protocol population, among participants who 
were seronegative at baseline. End points were 
judged by an independent adjudication committee 
that was unaware of group assignment. Covid-19 
cases were defined as occurring in participants 
who had at least two of the following symptoms: 
fever (temperature ≥38°C), chills, myalgia, head-
ache, sore throat, or new olfactory or taste dis-
order, or as occurring in those who had at least 
one respiratory sign or symptom (including cough, 
shortness of breath, or clinical or radiographic 
evidence of pneumonia) and at least one naso-
pharyngeal swab, nasal swab, or saliva sample 
(or respiratory sample, if the participant was 
hospitalized) that was positive for SARS-CoV-2 
by reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reac-
tion (RT-PCR) test. Participants were assessed for 
the presence of SARS-CoV-2–binding antibodies 
specific to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein 
(Roche Elecsys, Roche Diagnostics International) 
and had a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 
RT-PCR testing (Viracor, Eurofins Clinical Di-
agnostics) before each injection. SARS-CoV-2–
infected volunteers were followed daily, to assess 
symptom severity, for 14 days or until symptoms 
resolved, whichever was longer. A nasopharyn-
geal swab for RT-PCR testing and a blood sam-
ple for identifying serologic evidence of SARS-
CoV-2 infection were collected from participants 
with symptoms of Covid-19.

The consistency of vaccine efficacy at the pri-
mary end point was evaluated across various 
subgroups, including age groups (18 to <65 years 



n engl j med   nejm.org 4

T h e  n e w  e ngl a nd  j o u r na l  o f  m e dic i n e

of age and ≥65 years), age and health risk for 
severe disease (18 to <65 years and not at risk; 
18 to <65 years and at risk; and ≥65 years), sex 
(female or male), race and ethnic group, and risk 
for severe Covid-19 illness. If the number of 
participants in a subgroup was too small, it was 
combined with other subgroups for the sub-
group analyses.

A secondary end point was the efficacy of 
mRNA-1273 in the prevention of severe Covid-19 
as defined by one of the following criteria: respi-
ratory rate of 30 or more breaths per minute; 
heart rate at or exceeding 125 beats per minute; 
oxygen saturation at 93% or less while the par-
ticipant was breathing ambient air at sea level or 
a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen to the 
fraction of inspired oxygen below 300 mm Hg; 
respiratory failure; acute respiratory distress syn-
drome; evidence of shock (systolic blood pressure 
<90 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure <60 mm Hg, 
or a need for vasopressors); clinically significant 
acute renal, hepatic, or neurologic dysfunction; 
admission to an intensive care unit; or death. 
Additional secondary end points included the 
efficacy of the vaccine at preventing Covid-19 
after a single dose or at preventing Covid-19 ac-
cording to a secondary (CDC), less restrictive 
case definition: having any symptom of Covid-19 
and a positive SARS-CoV-2 test by RT-PCR (see 
Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, avail-
able at NEJM.org).

Statistical Analysis

For analysis of the primary end point, the trial 
was designed for the null hypothesis that the 
efficacy of the mRNA-1273 vaccine is 30% or 
less. A total of 151 cases of Covid-19 would pro-
vide 90% power to detect a 60% reduction in the 
hazard rate (i.e., 60% vaccine efficacy), with two 
planned interim analyses at approximately 35% 
and 70% of the target total number of cases 
(151) and with a one-sided O’Brien–Fleming 
boundary for efficacy and an overall one-sided 
error rate of 0.025. The efficacy of the mRNA-
1273 vaccine could be demonstrated at either the 
interim or the primary analysis, performed when 
the target total number of cases had been ob-
served. The Lan–DeMets alpha-spending func-
tion was used for calculating efficacy boundar-
ies at each analysis. At the first interim analysis 
on November 15, 2020, vaccine efficacy had been 
demonstrated in accordance with the prespeci-
fied statistical criteria. The vaccine efficacy esti-

mate, based on a total of 95 adjudicated cases 
(63% of the target total), was 94.5%, with a 
one-sided P value of less than 0.001 to reject the 
null hypothesis that vaccine efficacy would be 
30% or less. The data and safety monitoring 
board recommendation to the oversight group 
and the trial sponsor was that the efficacy find-
ings should be shared with the participants and 
the community (full details are available in the 
protocol and statistical analysis plan).

Vaccine efficacy was assessed in the full analy-
sis population (randomized participants who re-
ceived at least one dose of mRNA-1273 or pla-
cebo), the modified intention-to-treat population 
(participants in the full analysis population who 
had no immunologic or virologic evidence of 
Covid-19 on day 1, before the first dose), and the 
per-protocol population (participants in the mod-
ified intention-to-treat population who received 
two doses, with no major protocol deviations). 
The primary efficacy end point in the interim 
and primary analyses was assessed in the per-
protocol population. Participants were evaluated 
in the treatment groups to which they were as-
signed. Vaccine efficacy was defined as the per-
centage reduction in the hazard ratio for the 
primary end point (mRNA-1273 vs. placebo). A 
stratified Cox proportional hazards model was 
used to assess the vaccine efficacy of mRNA-1273 
as compared with placebo in terms of the per-
centage hazard reduction. (Details regarding the 
analysis of vaccine efficacy are provided in the 
Methods section of the Supplementary Appendix.)

Safety was assessed in all participants in the 
solicited safety population (i.e., those who re-
ceived at least one injection and reported a solic-
ited adverse event). Descriptive summary data 
(numbers and percentages) for participants with 
any solicited adverse events, unsolicited adverse 
events, unsolicited severe adverse events, serious 
adverse events, medically attended adverse 
events, and adverse events leading to discontinu-
ation of the injections or withdrawal from the 
trial are provided by group. Two-sided 95% exact 
confidence intervals (Clopper–Pearson method) 
are provided for the percentages of participants 
with solicited adverse events. Unsolicited adverse 
events are presented according to the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), ver-
sion 23.0, preferred terms and system organ 
class categories.

a median follow-up duration of at least 2 months

after completion of the two-dose regimen, a sec-
ond analysis was performed, with an efficacy 
data cutoff date of November 21, 2020. This 
second analysis is considered the primary analy-
sis of efficacy, with a total of 196 adjudicated 
Covid-19 cases in the per-protocol population, 
which exceeds the target total number of cases 
(151) specified in the protocol. This was an in-
crease from the 95 cases observed at the first 
interim analysis data cutoff on November 11, 
2020. Results from the primary analysis are pre-

sented in this report. Subsequent analyses are 
considered supplementary.

Trial Population

Between July 27, 2020, and October 23, 2020, a 
total of 30,420 participants underwent random-
ization, and the 15,210 participants in each 
group were assigned to receive two doses of ei-
ther placebo or mRNA-1273 (100 μg) (Fig. 1). 

Figure 1. Randomization and Analysis Populations.

The data cutoff for the primary analysis occurred on November 25, 2020. The full analysis population consisted of participants who un-
derwent randomization and received at least one dose of mRNA-1273 or placebo; the modified intention-to-treat population comprised 
participants in the full analysis population who had no immunologic or virologic evidence of Covid-19 on day 1, before the first dose; 
and the per-protocol analysis population included participants in the modified intention-to-treat population who received two doses, 
with no major protocol deviations. The safety population included all participants who received at least one injection. Among partici-
pants who received an incorrect injection, three participants in the mRNA-1273 group received at least one dose of placebo and no dose 
of mRNA-1273 and were included in the placebo safety population, and three received one dose of placebo and one dose of mRNA-1273 
and were included in the mRNA-1273 safety population; in the placebo group all seven received mRNA-1273 and were included in the 
mRNA-1273 safety population. Participants who received dose 2 outside the window for the per-protocol analysis are those who did not 
receive the second dose between 7 days before and 14 days after day 29.

Efficacy and Safety of mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine

More than 96% of participants received the sec-
ond dose (Fig. S1). Common reasons for not re-
ceiving the second dose were withdrawal of 
consent (153 participants) and the detection of 
SARS-CoV-2 by PCR before the administration 
of the second dose on day 29 (114 participants: 
69 in the placebo group and 45 in the mRNA-
1273 group). The primary efficacy and safety 
analyses were performed in the per-protocol and 
safety populations, respectively. Of the partici-
pants who received a first injection, 14,073 of 
those in the placebo group and 14,134 in the 
mRNA-1273 group were included in the primary 
efficacy analysis; 525 participants in the placebo 
group and 416 in the mRNA-1273 group were 
excluded from the per-protocol population, in-
cluding those who had not received a second 
dose by the day 29 data cutoff (Fig. 1). As of 
November 25, 2020, the participants had a me-
dian follow-up duration of 64 days (range, 0 to 
97) after the second dose, with 61% of partici-
pants having more than 56 days of follow-up.

Baseline demographic characteristics were 
balanced between the placebo group and the 
mRNA-1273 vaccine group (Table 1 and Table S2). 
The mean age of the participants was 51.4 years, 
47.3% of the participants were female, 24.8% 
were 65 years of age or older, and 16.7% were 
younger than 65 years of age and had predispos-
ing medical conditions that put them at risk for 
severe Covid-19. The majority of participants 
were White (79.2%), and the racial and ethnic 

proportions were generally representative of U.S. 
demographics, including 10.2% Black or African 
American and 20.5% Hispanic or Latino. Evi-
dence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline was 
present in 2.3% of participants in the mRNA-
1273 group and in 2.2% in the placebo group, as 
detected by serologic assay or RT-PCR testing.

Safety

Solicited adverse events at the injection site oc-
curred more frequently in the mRNA-1273 group 
than in the placebo group after both the first 
dose (84.2%, vs. 19.8%) and the second dose 
(88.6%, vs. 18.8%) (Fig. 2 and Tables S3 and S4). 
In the mRNA-1273 group, injection-site events 
were mainly grade 1 or 2 in severity and lasted 
a mean of 2.6 and 3.2 days after the first and 
second doses, respectively (Table S5). The most 
common injection-site event was pain after in-
jection (86.0%). Delayed injection-site reactions 
(those with onset on or after day 8) were noted 
in 244 participants (0.8%) after the first dose 
and in 68 participants (0.2%) after the second 
dose. Reactions were characterized by erythema, 
induration, and tenderness, and they resolved 
over the following 4 to 5 days. Solicited sys-
temic adverse events occurred more often in the 
mRNA-1273 group than in the placebo group 
after both the first dose (54.9%, vs. 42.2%) and 
the second dose (79.4%, vs. 36.5%). The severity 
of the solicited systemic events increased after 
the second dose in the mRNA-1273 group, with

§  Baseline SARS-CoV-2 status was positive if there was immunologic or virologic evidence of previous illness with Covid-19, as defined by 

a positive RT-PCR test or a positive bAb against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid assay result that was above the limit of detection or by a lower 
limit of quantification at day 1. Baseline SARS-CoV-2 status was negative if there was a negative RT-PCR test and negative bAb against 
SARS-CoV-2 assay result at day 1.

an increase in proportions of grade 2 events 
(from 16.5% after the first dose to 38.1% after 
the second dose) and grade 3 events (from 2.9% 
to 15.8%). Solicited systemic adverse events in the 
mRNA-1273 group lasted a mean of 2.6 days and 
3.1 days after the first and second doses, respec-

tively (Table S5). Both solicited injection-site and 
systemic adverse events were more common 
among younger participants (18 to <65 years of 
age) than among older participants (≥65 years 
of age). Solicited adverse events were less com-
mon in participants who were positive for SARS-

Efficacy and Safety of mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine

CoV-2 infection at baseline than in those who 
were negative at baseline (Tables S6 and S7).

The frequency of unsolicited adverse events, 
unsolicited severe adverse events, and serious 
adverse events reported during the 28 days after 
injection was generally similar among partici-
pants in the two groups (Tables S8 through S11). 
Three deaths occurred in the placebo group (one 
from intraabdominal perforation, one from car-
diopulmonary arrest, and one from severe sys-
temic inflammatory syndrome in a participant 
with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and diffuse 
bullous rash) and two in the vaccine group (one 
from cardiopulmonary arrest and one by sui-
cide). The frequency of grade 3 adverse events in 
the placebo group (1.3%) was similar to that in 
the vaccine group (1.5%), as were the frequencies 
of medically attended adverse events (9.7% vs. 
9.0%) and serious adverse events (0.6% in both 
groups). Hypersensitivity reactions were report-
ed in 1.5% and 1.1% of participants in the vac-
cine and placebo groups, respectively (Table S12). 
Bell’s palsy occurred in the vaccine group (3 par-
ticipants [<0.1%]) and the placebo group (1 partici-
pant [<0.1%]) during the observation period of 
the trial (more than 28 days after injection). 
Overall, 0.5% of participants in the placebo 
group and 0.3% in the mRNA-1273 group had 
adverse events that resulted in their not receiving 
the second dose, and less than 0.1% of partici-
pants in both groups discontinued participation 
in the trial because of adverse events after any 
dose (Table S8). No evidence of vaccine-associated 
enhanced respiratory disease was noted, and 
fewer cases of severe Covid-19 or any Covid-19 
were observed among participants who received 
mRNA-1273 than among those who received 
placebo (Tables S13 and S14). Adverse events 
that were deemed by the trial team to be related 
to the vaccine or placebo were reported among 
4.5% of participants in the placebo group and 
8.2% in the mRNA-1273 group. The most com-
mon treatment-related adverse events (those re-
ported in at least 1% of participants) in the pla-
cebo group and the mRNA-1273 group were 
fatigue (1.2% and 1.5%) and headache (0.9% and 
1.4%). In the overall population, the incidence of 
treatment-related severe adverse events was 
higher in the mRNA-1273 group (71 participants 
[0.5%]) than in the placebo group (28 partici-
pants [0.2%]) (Tables S8 and S15). The relative 

incidence of these adverse events according to 
vaccine group was not affected by age.

Efficacy

After day 1 and through November 25, 2020, a 
total of 269 Covid-19 cases were identified, with 
an incidence of 79.8 cases per 1000 person-years 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 70.5 to 89.9) 
among participants in the placebo group with 
no evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
For the primary analysis, 196 cases of Covid-19 
were diagnosed: 11 cases in the vaccine group 
(3.3 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 1.7 to 6.0) 
and 185 cases in the placebo group (56.5 per 
1000 person-years; 95% CI, 48.7 to 65.3), indi-
cating 94.1% efficacy of the mRNA-1273 vaccine 
(95% CI, 89.3 to 96.8%; P<0.001) for the preven-
tion of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection as 
compared with placebo (Fig. 3A). Findings were 
similar across key secondary analyses (Table 
S16), including assessment starting 14 days after 
dose 1 (225 cases with placebo, vs. 11 with 
mRNA-1273, indicating a vaccine efficacy of 
95.2% [95% CI, 91.2 to 97.4]), and assessment 
including participants who were SARS-CoV-2 
seropositive at baseline in the per-protocol anal-
ysis (187 cases with placebo, vs. 12 with mRNA-
1273; one volunteer assigned to receive mRNA-
1273 was inadvertently given placebo], indicating 
a vaccine efficacy of 93.6% [95% CI, 88.6 to 
96.5]). Between days 1 and 42, seven cases of 
Covid-19 were identified in the mRNA-1273 
group, as compared with 65 cases in the placebo 
group (Fig. 3B).

A key secondary end point evaluated the effi-
cacy of mRNA-1273 at preventing severe Covid-
 19. Thirty participants in the trial had severe 
 Covid-19; all 30 were in the placebo group (indi-
cating vaccine efficacy of 100% [95% CI, could 
not be estimated to 1.0]), and one death among 
these participants was attributed to Covid-19 
(Table S16). The vaccine efficacy to prevent 
Covid-19 was consistent across subgroups strati-
fied by demographic and baseline characteristics 
(Fig. 4): age groups (18 to <65 years of age and 
≥65 years), presence of risk for severe Covid-19, 
sex, and race and ethnic group (non-Hispanic 
White and communities of color). Among par-
ticipants who were positive for SARS-CoV-2, by 
serologic or virologic testing, at baseline (337 in 
the placebo group and 343 in the mRNA-1273

group), one case of Covid-19 was diagnosed by 
RT-PCR testing in a placebo recipient and no 
cases were diagnosed in mRNA-1273 recipients 
(Table S17). Among participants who were nega-
tive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline (by RT-PCR or 
antibody testing), in addition to symptomatic 
Covid-19 cases 39 (0.3%) in the placebo group 
and 15 (0.1%) in the mRNA-1273 group had 
nasopharyngeal swabs that were positive for 
SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR at the second dose visit 
(surveillance swab) but had no evidence of 
 Covid-19 symptoms (Table S18).

Discussion

The COVE trial provides evidence of short-term 
efficacy of the mRNA-1273 vaccine in preventing 
symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in a diverse 
adult trial population. Of note, the trial was 
designed for an infection attack rate of 0.75%, 
which would have necessitated a follow-up peri-
od of 6 months after the two vaccine doses to 
accrue 151 cases in 30,000 participants. The 
pandemic trajectory accelerated in many U.S. 
regions in the late summer and fall of 2020, re-
sulting in rapid accrual of 196 cases after a 
median follow-up of 2 months. It is important to 
note that all the severe Covid-19 cases were in 

the placebo group, which suggests that mRNA-
1273 is likely to have an effect on preventing 
severe illness, which is the major cause of health 
care utilization, complications, and death. The 
finding of fewer occurrences of symptomatic 
SARS-CoV-2 infection after a single dose of 
mRNA-1273 is encouraging; however, the trial 
was not designed to evaluate the efficacy of a 
single dose, and additional evaluation is war-
ranted.

The magnitude of mRNA-1273 vaccine effi-
cacy at preventing symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 in-
fection is higher than the efficacy observed for 
vaccines for respiratory viruses, such as the in-
activated influenza vaccine against symptomatic, 
virologically confirmed disease in adults, for 
which studies have shown a pooled efficacy of 
59%.19 This high apparent efficacy of mRNA-
1273 is based on short-term data, and waning of 
efficacy over time has been demonstrated with 
other vaccines.20 Also, the efficacy of the vaccine 
was tested in a setting of national recommenda-
tions for masking and social distancing, which 
may have translated into lower levels of infec-
tious inoculum. The efficacy of mRNA-1273 is in 
line with that of the recently reported BNT162b2 
mRNA vaccine.16 The COVE trial is ongoing, and 
longitudinal follow-up will allow an assessment 
of efficacy changes over time and under evolving 
epidemiologic conditions.

Overall, the safety of the mRNA-1273 vaccine 
regimen and platform is reassuring; no unex-
pected patterns of concern were identified. The 
reactogenicity associated with immunization 
with mRNA-1273 in this trial is similar to that 
in the phase 1 data reported previously.1,4 Over-
all, the local reactions to vaccination were mild; 
however, moderate-to-severe systemic side ef-
fects, such as fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, and 
headache, were noted in about 50% of partici-
pants in the mRNA-1273 group after the second 
dose. These side effects were transient, starting 
about 15 hours after vaccination and resolving in 
most participants by day 2, without sequelae. 
The degree of reactogenicity after one dose of 
mRNA-1273 was less than that observed for the 
recently approved recombinant adjuvanted zoster 
vaccine and after the second mRNA-1273 dose 
was similar to that of the zoster vaccine.21,22

Shown is the cumulative incidence of Covid-19 events 
in the primary analysis based on adjudicated assess-
ment starting 14 days after the second vaccination in 
the per-protocol population (Panel A) and after ran-
domization in the modified intention-to-treat popula-
tion (Panel B) (see the Supplementary Appendix). The 
dotted line in Panel A indicates day 42 (14 days after 
vaccination 2), when the per-protocol follow-up began, 
and arrows in both panels indicate days 1 and 29, when 
injections were administered. Tick marks indicate cen-
sored data. Vaccine efficacy was defined as 1 minus the 
hazard ratio (mRNA vs. placebo), and the 95% confi-
dence interval was estimated with the use of a stratified 
Cox proportional hazards model, with Efron’s method 
of tie handling and with treatment group as a covariate, 
with adjustment for stratification factor. Incidence was 
defined as the number of events divided by number of 
participants at risk and was adjusted by person-years. 
Symptomatic Covid-19 case accrual for placebo and vac-
cine in the modified intention-to-treat population is dis-
played (does not include asymptomatic cases of SARS-
CoV-2 detected at the day 29 by nasopharyngeal swab).

8 days or more after injection, were uncommon. 
The overall incidence of unsolicited adverse 
events reported up to 28 days after vaccination 
and of serious adverse events reported through-
out the entire trial was similar for mRNA-1273 
and placebo. A risk of acute hypersensitivity is 
sometimes observed with vaccines; however, no 
such risk was evident in the COVE trial, although 
the ability to detect rare events is limited, given 
the trial sample size. The anecdotal finding of a 
slight excess of Bell’s palsy in this trial and in 
the BNT162b2 vaccine trial arouses concern that 
it may be more than a chance event, and the 
possibility bears close monitoring.16

The mRNA-1273 vaccine did not show evi-
dence in the short term of enhanced respiratory 
disease after infection, a concern that emerged 
from animal models used in evaluating some 
SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome 
(MERS) vaccine constructs.23-25 A hallmark of 
enhanced respiratory disease is a Th2-skewed 

immune response and eosinophilic pulmonary 
infiltration on histopathological examination. 
Of note, preclinical testing of mRNA-1273 and 
other SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in advanced clinical 
evaluation has shown a Th1-skewed vaccine re-
sponse and no pathologic lung infiltrates.15,26-28 
Whether mRNA-1273 vaccination results in en-
hanced disease on exposure to the virus in the 
long term is unknown.

Key limitations of the data are the short dura-
tion of safety and efficacy follow-up. The trial is 
ongoing, and a follow-up duration of 2 years is 
planned, with possible changes to the trial de-
sign to allow participant retention and ongoing 
data collection. Another limitation is the lack of 
an identified correlate of protection, a critical 
tool for future bridging studies. As of the data 
cutoff, 11 cases of Covid-19 had occurred in the 
mRNA-1273 group, a finding that limits our 
ability to detect a correlate of protection. As 
cases accrue and immunity wanes, it may be-

Figure 4. Vaccine Efficacy of mRNA-1273 to Prevent Covid-19 in Subgroups.

The efficacy of the RNA-1273 vaccine in preventing Covid-19 in various subgroups in the per-protocol population 
was based on adjudicated assessments starting 14 days after the second injection. Vaccine efficacy, defined as 1 
minus the hazard ratio (mRNA-1273 vs. placebo), and 95% confidence intervals were estimated with the use of a 
stratified Cox proportional hazards model, with Efron’s method of tie handling and with the treatment group as a 
covariate, adjusting for stratification factor if applicable. Race and ethnic group categories shown are White (non-
Hispanic) and communities of color (all others, including those whose race and ethnicity were both reported as un-
known, were not reported, or were both missing at screening). Data for communities of color were pooled owing to 
limited numbers of participants in each racial or ethnic group, to ensure that the subpopulations would be large 
enough for meaningful analyses.

Efficacy and Safety of mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine

come possible to determine such a correlate. In 
addition, although our trial showed that mRNA-
1273 reduces the incidence of symptomatic 
SARS-CoV-2 infection, the data were not suffi-
cient to assess asymptomatic infection, although 
our results from a preliminary exploratory anal-
ysis suggest that some degree of prevention may 
be afforded after the first dose. Evaluation of the 
incidence of asymptomatic or subclinical infec-
tion and viral shedding after infection are under 
way, to assess whether vaccination affects infec-
tiousness. The relatively smaller numbers of 
cases that occurred in older adults and in par-
ticipants from ethnic or racial minorities and 
the small number of previously infected persons 
who received the vaccine limit efficacy evalua-
tions in these groups. Longer-term data from 
the ongoing trial may allow a more careful 
evaluation of the vaccine efficacy in these 
groups. Pregnant women and children were ex-
cluded from this trial, and additional evaluation 
of the vaccine in these groups is planned.

Within 1 year after the emergence of this 
novel infection that caused a pandemic, a patho-
gen was determined, vaccine targets were identi-
fied, vaccine constructs were created, manufac-
turing to scale was developed, phase 1 through 
phase 3 testing was conducted, and data have 
been reported. This process demonstrates what 
is possible in the context of motivated collabora-
tion among key sectors of society, including aca-
demia, government, industry, regulators, and the 
larger community. Lessons learned from this 
endeavor should allow us to better prepare for 
the next pandemic pathogen.
