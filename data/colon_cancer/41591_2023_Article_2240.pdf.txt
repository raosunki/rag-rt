Codon-specific KRAS mutations predict 
survival benefit of trifluridine/tipiracil in 
metastatic colorectal cancer

Genomics has greatly improved how patients with cancer are being 
treated; however, clinical-grade genomic biomarkers for chemotherapies 
are currently lacking. Using whole-genome analysis of 37 patients with 
metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) treated with the chemotherapy 
trifluridine/tipiracil (FTD/TPI), we identified KRAS codon G12 (KRASG12) 
mutations as a potential biomarker of resistance. Next, we collected 
real-world data of 960 patients with mCRC receiving FTD/TPI and validated 
that KRASG12 mutations were significantly associated with poor survival, also 
in analyses restricted to the RAS/RAF mutant subgroup. We next analyzed 
the data of the global, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 RECOURSE 
trial (n = 800 patients) and found that KRASG12 mutations (n = 279) were 
predictive biomarkers for reduced overall survival (OS) benefit of FTD/TPI 
versus placebo (unadjusted interaction P = 0.0031, adjusted interaction 
P = 0.015). For patients with KRASG12 mutations in the RECOURSE trial, OS was 
not prolonged with FTD/TPI versus placebo (n = 279; hazard ratio (HR) = 0.97; 
95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.73–1.20; P = 0.85). In contrast, patients with 
KRASG13 mutant tumors showed significantly improved OS with FTD/TPI 
versus placebo (n = 60; HR = 0.29; 95% CI = 0.15–0.55; P < 0.001). In isogenic 
cell lines and patient-derived organoids, KRASG12 mutations were associated 
with increased resistance to FTD-based genotoxicity. In conclusion, these 
data show that KRASG12 mutations are biomarkers for reduced OS benefit 
of FTD/TPI treatment, with potential implications for approximately 28% 
of patients with mCRC under consideration for treatment with FTD/TPI. 
Furthermore, our data suggest that genomics-based precision medicine may 
be possible for a subset of chemotherapies.

Systemic anticancer therapy based on the chemotherapeutic agents 
5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/capecitabine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan in com-
bination with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or vascular 
endothelial growth factor inhibitors are the cornerstone of the treat-
ment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)1. More recently, the 
chemotherapeutic drug trifluridine/tipiracil (FTD/TPI), a combination 

of trifluridine (FTD), a nucleoside analog, and tipiracil (TPI), a thymidine 
phosphorylase inhibitor, has been approved for patients with advanced, 
heavily pretreated mCRC2–4. Although durable responses to FTD/TPI 
have been observed in some patients with mCRC, the median overall 
survival (OS) benefit in the general population with mCRC is modest 
(1.8 months), highlighting the unmet need for patient selection1,3,5–9.

a codon-agnostic manner diluted the observed effect (Fig. 1a,b and 
Supplementary Table 4). Similar results were obtained when time on 
FTD/TPI treatment was used as the end point (Extended Data Fig. 3 and 
Supplementary Table 5). Based on these hypothesis-generating results, 
we wondered if KRASG12 mutation status could be a determinant of FTD/
TPI treatment outcome in mCRC.

KRAS mutations and real-world survival on FTD/TPI treatment
We next collected real-world data of 960 patients with mCRC who were 
treated with FTD/TPI in 36 centers across Italy and the UK (Supplemen-
tary Tables 6 and 7). Based on routine diagnostics (largely performed at 
diagnosis), the cohort contained 385 patients with RAS/RAF wild-type 
(WT) tumors, 343 patients with KRASG12 mutations, 86 patients with 
KRASG13 mutations, 53 patients with KRAS mutations at codons other 
than G12 or G13 (KRASother), 32 patients with BRAF mutations and 61 
patients with NRAS mutations. In the full population, patients with 
KRASG12 mutations had more frequent right-sided disease and more 
recent diagnoses of metastatic disease (Table 1). Importantly, these 
factors were well balanced when patients with KRASG12 mutations were 
compared to patients with other RAS/RAF mutations, or specifically to 
those with hotspot mutations affecting the directly adjacent codon 
KRASG13, whereas this latter subgroup had relatively good performance 
status (Table 1).

In the real-world validation cohort, codon-specific RAS/RAF muta-
tions were significantly associated with clear differences in OS on 
treatment with FTD/TPI (log-rank P < 0.001; Fig. 2a). Again, KRASG12 
mutations were significantly associated with poor OS, with a similar 
effect in the population as a whole (unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) for 
death = 1.31; 95% CI = 1.11–1.55; P = 0.0017; adjusted HR for death = 1.24; 
95% CI = 1.04–1.47, P = 0.016; Fig. 2b, left panel), as in the RAS/RAF 
mutant subpopulation (unadjusted HR for death = 1.30; 95% CI, 1.04–
1.61, P = 0.019; adjusted HR for death, 1.28; 95% CI 1.03–1.60, P = 0.027; 
Fig. 2b, middle panel). Notably, the OS of patients with KRASG12 muta-
tions was also poor as compared with patients with KRASG13 muta-
tions (unadjusted HR for death = 1.79; 95% CI = 1.29–2.48; P < 0.001; 
adjusted HR for death = 1.61; 95% CI = 1.15–2.26, P = 0.0061; Fig. 2b, right 
panel). Similar results were obtained when the analysis was based on 
progression-free survival (PFS) (Extended Data Fig. 4). Patients with 
KRASG12 mutations did not show significantly shorter OS than patients 
in any of the other, smaller RAS/RAF mutant subgroups (those with 

Precision medicine is widely used to select patients for targeted 
therapies and immunotherapies for mCRC according to the presence 
or absence of genomic biomarkers. As such, the detection of KRAS 
hotspot mutations is a critical step in the diagnostic workup of mCRC 
as RAS/RAF mutations predict clinical resistance to EGFR-targeting 
antibodies10–12. Such KRAS mutations are found in 44% of patients 
with mCRC; these most frequently occur at codon G12 (KRASG12; 28% 
of patients) or codon G13 (KRASG13; 8% of patients) (Extended Data  
Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1)13. Although KRASG12 and KRASG13 
mutations are regarded as a single entity in clinical practice guidelines, 
they have different biochemical properties14,15 and display tissue- and 
treatment-specific mutational patterns16.

In this study, given the lack of genomic biomarkers and the lim-
ited clinical benefit of FTD/TPI in unselected patients with mCRC, we 
harnessed the power of whole-genome somatic profiles coupled with 
patient outcomes to identify biomarkers of response and resistance 
to FTD/TPI. Key findings were then validated in a real-world cohort of 
FTD/TPI-treated patients with mCRC (n = 960) and in the double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, phase 3 RECOURSE trial (n = 800; study overview 
shown in Extended Data Fig. 2).

Results
KRASG12 mutations as potential biomarkers for FTD/TPI 
treatment
We first performed whole-genome analysis of a real-world discovery 
cohort that consisted of 37 patients with mCRC from the publicly avail-
able Hartwig Medical Foundation database17, who received FTD/TPI 
treatment in a standard-of-care setting in 13 hospitals across the Neth-
erlands (Hartwig Medical Foundation (HMF) cohort; Supplementary 
Table 2). In accordance with late-stage disease, the median OS was rela-
tively short, that is, 6.1 months (95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.2– 8.3). 
Ten genomic drivers occurred in at least five patients and were tested 
as candidate biomarkers for OS (Supplementary Table 3 and Meth-
ods). After correction for multiple-hypothesis testing, KRASG12 status 
was most significantly associated with reduced OS (exact log-rank 
test-based two-sided P = 0.0016; Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery 
rate (FDR) = 0.016; threshold for significance, FDR < 0.05; Fig. 1a,b 
and Supplementary Table 4). Besides 20 patients with KRASG12 muta-
tions, the cohort also included four patients with KRAS mutations 
at other codons. Consideration of all KRAS mutations combined in

KRASother, BRAF or NRAS mutations; statistics not shown). Together, 
this independent validation confirmed that patients with KRASG12 
mutant mCRC have relatively poor OS on treatment with FTD/TPI. 
Furthermore, the clear OS difference between patients with KRASG12 
and KRASG13 mutations underwrites the rationale for considering KRAS 
mutations in a codon-specific manner.

KRAS mutations and survival in the RECOURSE trial
To further strengthen our findings and investigate if our observa-
tions were based on prognostic or predictive effects, we analyzed the 

data of a large, independent, placebo-controlled clinical cohort, the 
RECOURSE trial3. Briefly, this international, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, phase 3 study assigned 800 heavily pretreated 
patients with mCRC to receive either FTD/TPI or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. 
Based on routine diagnostics (largely performed at diagnosis), approxi-
mately half of the patients (n = 393) were KRASWT, whereas the other 
half (n = 407) were KRAS mutant. In this study, KRAS mutation status 
(mutated yes/no) was not significantly associated with reduced OS 
or PFS benefit of FTD/TPI versus placebo; however, codon-specific 
analyses were not performed3,4.

Codon-specific mutational status was available for 367 out of 407 
(90%) patients with KRAS-mutated tumors in the RECOURSE trial. Of 
these, 279 (76%) had KRASG12 mutations, 60 (16%) had KRASG13 muta-
tions, 21 (5.7%) were reported to have KRASG12/G13 double mutations 
(largely due to the use of analytical methods that could not discrimi-
nate between the two codons) and 7 (1.9%) had other mutations. (The 
true percentage of patients with other mutations was probably higher 
because their assessment was only broadly implemented later11.) 

Throughout our analyses, we considered patients with KRASG12/G13 
double mutations as a distinct subgroup.

The prespecified baseline characteristics of the RECOURSE trial 
were well balanced between the FTD/TPI and placebo arms in KRASG12 
mutant, KRASG13 mutant and KRASWT subgroups (Table 2), with some 
exceptions; patients whose tumors harbored a KRAS mutation gener-
ally had more recent diagnoses of metastatic disease, were less heavily 
pretreated and were more frequently refractory to fluoropyrimidine

as part of the last previous regimen (Table 2). Importantly, all these 
factors were balanced between the KRASG12 and KRASG13 mutant popula-
tions. Between these two groups, the only significant difference was 
that patients with KRASG13 mutations originated less often from Japan 
(Table 2).

To understand the prognostic effects of codon-specific KRAS 
mutations in the trial population, we first analyzed OS in the placebo 
arm (Extended Data Fig. 5). This showed that patients with the KRASG12 
and KRASWT mutants had similar OS. Interestingly, placebo-treated 
patients with KRASG13 mutations (the other main KRAS mutant subgroup 
in the study) had a remarkably shorter OS than those with KRASG12 
mutations (median OS KRASG13 mutants: 2.9 months, 95% CI = 2.1–6.1 
months versus median OS KRASG12 mutants: 5.8 months, 95% CI = 4.7–
7.3; HR = 2.20; 95% CI = 1.25–3.86; P = 0.0060; Extended Data Fig. 5),  
which held after adjustment for the ten baseline characteristics 

(HR = 2.46; 95% CI = 1.33–4.57; P = 0.0043; Extended Data Fig. 5). In 
the placebo arm, patients with KRASG13 mutant tumors also had shorter 
OS than those with KRASWT tumors, which was statistically significant in 
unadjusted analysis (HR = 1.95; 95% CI = 1.13–3.36; P = 0.017; Extended 
Data Fig. 5), but did not attain statistical significance in the adjusted 
analysis (HR = 1.79; 95% CI = 0.96–3.32; P = 0.065; Extended Data  
Fig. 5). Taken together, these analyses indicate that KRASG12 mutations 
are not associated with poor prognosis in late-stage mCRC.

We then studied if KRASG12 mutations were predictive biomark-
ers for reduced OS benefit of FTD/TPI in the RECOURSE trial. In the 
KRASG12 mutant population (n = 279 patients), OS was not prolonged 
with FTD/TPI versus placebo (HR = 0.96; 95% CI = 0.71–1.29; P = 0.78; 
Fig. 3a, upper left). Within the full study population (n = 800 patients), 
KRASG12 mutations were significantly associated with a reduced OS 
benefit of FTD/TPI versus placebo (unadjusted interaction P = 0.0031;

adjusted interaction P = 0.015; Fig. 3b; full regression model fits shown 
in Supplementary Table 8). In analyses restricted to the subgroup with 
KRAS mutations (n = 407 patients), KRASG12 mutations were also signifi-
cantly associated with reduced OS benefit of FTD/TPI versus placebo 
(unadjusted interaction P = 0.0091; adjusted interaction P = 0.0037; 
full regression model fits shown in Supplementary Table 8). Further 
stratification of patients with KRASG12 mutations according to differ-
ent amino acid changes did not provide evidence of OS benefit with 
FTD/TPI versus placebo in any subgroup (Extended Data Fig. 6). Taken 
together, these data demonstrate that FTD/TPI treatment did not lead 
to a clinically relevant prolongation of OS in patients with mCRC with 
KRASG12 mutations in the RECOURSE trial.

When patients whose tumors harbored a KRASG12 mutation were 
excluded from the analysis, FTD/TPI resulted in a pronounced OS 
benefit over placebo (n = 521; HR = 0.55; 95% CI = 0.45–0.69; P < 0.001; 
Fig. 3a, upper right), with a median OS benefit of 2.7 months in this 
subgroup (versus 1.8 months in the full population, as reported by 
Mayer et al.3).

Next, we analyzed the treatment effect of FTD/TPI in patients with 
KRASG13 mutant tumors. In sharp contrast to the KRASG12 mutant popula-
tion, patients with the KRASG13 mutation showed a clear OS benefit in 
the FTD/TPI arm versus the placebo arm (HR = 0.34; 95% CI = 0.17–0.67; 
P = 0.0018; Fig. 3a, lower left). This remained significant in the adjusted 
analysis (HR = 0.21; 95% CI = 0.090–0.48; P < 0.001; Fig. 3b). The median 
OS was three times longer in the FTD/TPI arm versus the placebo arm 
(8.7 versus 2.9 months; Fig. 3). The OS benefit of FTD/TPI treatment 
was significantly more pronounced in patients with KRASG13-mutated 
mCRC versus those with KRASG12-mutated disease (unadjusted 
interaction P = 0.0026; adjusted interaction P = 0.0023; Fig. 3b; 
the full regression model fits are shown in Supplementary Table 8).  
Thus, KRASG13 mutations marked patients with clear OS benefit from 
FTD/TPI treatment.

We then assessed PFS in KRAS codon-specific subgroups of the 
RECOURSE trial. A minimal PFS benefit of FTD/TPI versus placebo 
was observed in all three subgroups (median PFS benefit 0.1, 0.3 and 
0.3 months for patients with KRASG12, KRASG13 and KRASWT mutations, 
respectively), which did not significantly differ among these subpop-
ulations (interactions nonsignificant for all pairwise comparisons; 
Extended Data Fig. 7).

KRASG12 mutations and FTD/TPI resistance in vitro
Finally, we aimed to replicate these findings in vitro using isogenic 
cell lines and mCRC patient-derived organoids (PDOs) (n = 7; Supple-
mentary Table 9). KRASG12 mutation knock in significantly reduced 
responsiveness to FTD (the cytotoxic component of FTD/TPI) in two 
colorectal cancer cell line models, SW48 and Colo320 (two-sided 
Wilcoxon rank-sum-based P = 0.029 for both models; Fig. 4a–d). The 
parental models are KRASWT and do not harbor other frequent mCRC 
oncogenic drivers like mutations in NRAS, BRAF, PTEN or PIK3CA. 
Similar results were obtained with PDOs, with KRASG12-mutated lines 
consistently showing reduced FTD responsiveness (two-sided Wil-
coxon rank-sum-based P = 0.034; Fig. 4e,f). Notably, the presence of 
a KRASG12 mutation was associated with suppression of FTD-induced 
DNA damage (as measured by γH2AX) in both isogenic cell lines and 
PDOs (Fig. 4g,h). We next tested in vitro sensitivity to 5-FU because 
this chemotherapeutic is closely related to FTD/TPI but exerts its 
main effect through damaging RNA rather than DNA. In all models, 
KRASG12 mutations did not significantly reduce in vitro sensitivity to 
5-FU (Fig. 4i–l). Of note, the higher sensitivity to FTD in KRASWT mod-
els could not be explained by higher baseline proliferation rates, as 
the (untreated) KRASWT PDOs demonstrated lower proliferation rates 
than (untreated) KRASG12 PDOs (Extended Data Fig. 8). Taken together, 
these results show that KRASG12 mutation-based resistance to FTD 
can be modeled in vitro and is characterized by limited FTD-induced  
DNA damage.

Discussion
Using two independent real-world datasets from three different 
countries and an independent validation cohort based on the global, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 RECOURSE trial, we dem-
onstrate that codon-specific KRAS mutations predict OS benefit for 
patients treated with the chemotherapeutic agent FTD/TPI in late-stage 
mCRC. Specifically, KRASG12 mutations identify patients who experi-
ence no clinically relevant18 survival benefit from FTD/TPI, while the 
remaining population—including KRASG13-mutated patients—benefits 
substantially. The RECOURSE trial showed only a modest OS benefit 
of FTD/TPI versus placebo in the general, unselected population with 
mCRC. In this context, our results offer a framework to (re)assess the 
risk–benefit profile of FTD/TPI according to codon-specific KRAS muta-
tions. Given that KRAS testing is routinely performed in the molecular 
workup of all patients with CRC to guide treatment with EGFR-targeting 
agents1,11, our findings can be readily adopted in the clinic.

In line with previous clinical and preclinical evidence14–16, our data 
demonstrate that KRASG12 and KRASG13 mutated mCRC are different 
clinical entities. The former disease is characterized by better prog-
nosis but shows no clinically relevant OS benefit of FTD/TPI treatment 
(predictive effect), whereas the latter disease behaves aggressively 
when treated with placebo but can be more effectively managed with 
FTD/TPI treatment. These data caution against lumping together KRAS 
mutations at different codons in biomarker analyses and clinical trial 
designs because different biological and biochemical properties may 
be associated with different clinical outcomes.

The primary objective of the RECOURSE trial was to detect differ-
ences in OS between FTD/TPI and placebo, the gold standard outcome 
measure for regulatory approval studies for new treatments for meta-
static cancer19,20. One of the reasons for this is that marginal improve-
ments in PFS may not translate into an OS benefit21 as we observe in the 
subpopulation of the RECOURSE trial with KRASG12 mutant tumors. The 
main caveat of OS is that lines of treatment administered after progres-
sion on the study drug might bias the conclusions. Notably, informa-
tion on 5-FU-based rechallenges was not collected in the RECOURSE 
trial but are unlikely to underlie the reduced OS benefit of FTD/TPI in 
the population with KRASG12 mutations. The reason is that this would 
require that placebo-treated patients with KRASG12 mutations received 
considerably more treatments after progression in the study than FTD/
TPI-treated patients with KRASG12 mutations. Nevertheless, even in this 
unlikely scenario the conclusion would still be that, in terms of OS, the 
treatment with FTD/TPI has not been a useful intervention because 
it did not provide a relevant OS benefit over treatment with placebo.

Analysis of the real-world validation cohort showed that mis-
match repair (MMR) deficiency was rare (Table 1) and was not associ-
ated with KRASG12 status nor with OS of patients treated with FTD/TPI 
(data not shown). Furthermore, tumor sidedness was well balanced 
among all RAS/RAF-based subgroups of the real-world cohort and 
adjustment for this covariate in multivariate models did not affect our 
conclusions. In addition, pretreatment variables, such as the number 
of previous regimens, refractoriness to fluoropyrimidine or previ-
ous use of regorafenib were not responsible for our results. Namely, 
our RECOURSE trial-based analyses showed that these (1) were well 
balanced between the populations with KRASG12 and KRASG13 mutant 
tumors, (2) were not associated with OS benefit of FTD/TPI versus 
placebo and (3) did not alter our conclusions when incorporated into  
multivariate models.

While all RAS/RAF-based subgroups were molecularly well defined 
in our real-world datasets, this classification was not as complete in 
the RECOURSE trial. Indeed, KRAS hotspot mutations outside codons 
G12 and G13 were only tested in a small fraction of the RECOURSE trial 
population and data on NRAS and BRAF mutations were (largely) miss-
ing. Given the results of our real-world analyses, patients with KRAS 
mutations outside of codons G12 and G13 or BRAF mutations may 
more closely resemble patients with KRASG12 mutations; inclusions

of these cases in the KRASWT group might have underestimated the 
survival benefit conferred by FTD/TPI in the ‘real’ KRASWT population. 
A further observation with potential clinical implications relates to the 
fact that virtually all KRASWT patients in our cohorts were pretreated 
with anti-EGFR therapeutics, while their RAS (and RAF) status was 
determined before any therapy. Given that RAS mutations can emerge 
as drivers of acquired resistance in this scenario22, some patients might 
have been misclassified. Although the above considerations are impor-
tant to keep in mind when interpreting the results, our conclusions hold 

regardless because such misclassifications may only have diluted the 
differences between the analyzed subgroups.

A potential limitation of our study is that this investigator-initiated 
reanalysis of the RECOURSE trial was not predefined in the original 
trial protocol. However, based on our findings, this reanalysis was 
hypothesis-driven and prespecified in a formal data request before 
access to the RECOURSE trial data was granted.

Several clinico-pathological and molecular biomarkers of benefit 
to FTD/TPI have been tested but none has reached clinical application23.

Our results show that KRAS mutational analysis, a standard-of-care test 
already implemented worldwide, can identify patients with KRASG12 
mutant mCRC who are unlikely to benefit from FTD/TPI treatment, 
avoiding unnecessary toxicities to patients and rationalizing the use 
of resources for healthcare systems. Thus, we report the first proof 
of genomics-based precision medicine for a chemotherapy in mCRC, 
which has the potential to substantially improve patient selection for 
FTD/TPI treatment.

Methods
Study participants
Discovery cohort. The large, publicly available, real-world dataset with 
clinical annotation and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) by the HMF 
was used as the discovery cohort17. All patients who received FTD/TPI 
as part of their standard-of-care treatment for mCRC were identified 
in May 2018 (Supplementary Table 2). These patients were included in 
13 academic, teaching, and regional hospitals in the Netherlands. The 
study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the University 
Medical Center Utrecht and was conducted in accordance with the 
Declaration of Helsinki (fourth edition). All patients provided written 
informed consent for the collection, analysis and pseudonymized 
sharing of paired tumor-normal WGS data and clinical characteristics 
for research purposes.

Real-world validation cohort. For validation, we retrospectively col-
lected data of 1,012 patients with mCRC treated with FTD/TPI as part of 
standard of care between April 2016 and January 2022 at 36 academic, 
teaching and regional hospitals across Italy and the UK (Supplementary 
Tables 6 and 7). The data cutoff was April 2022. Tumor KRAS, NRAS 
and BRAF genotype was investigated locally as recommended by local 
guidelines. Fifty-two patients with unknown NRAS or BRAF status were 
excluded, resulting in a final cohort of 960 patients used for all analyses. 
For patients from the UK, the study built on a UK National Audit24 and 
data were handled in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. For-
mal ethical approval for data collection, analysis and pseudonymized 
sharing for research purposes was covered by UK Health Research 
Authority guidance (NHS Health Research Authority, Service Evaluation 
Clinical/Non-Financial Audit Usual Practice (in Public Health Including 
Health Protection)). For patients from Italy, data collection, analysis 
and pseudonymized sharing for research purposes was approved by 
the institutional review board of the Fondazione Istituto di Ricovero e 
Cura a Carattere Scientifico Ca’ Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico 
(Milano, Italy) and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration 
of Helsinki.

RECOURSE trial cohort. The RECOURSE trial design has been previ-
ously described in detail3. Briefly, the RECOURSE trial (NCT01607957) 
was an international double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 
phase 3 trial comparing FTD/TPI plus best supportive care to placebo 
plus best supportive care. Heavily pretreated patients with refractory 
mCRC (n = 800) were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive FTD/
TPI or placebo. Within this process, patients were stratified based on 
KRAS status (mutant yes/no), time between first diagnosis of metas-
tases and randomization (<18 versus ≥18 months) and geographical 
region ( Japan or USA, Europe and Australia). The data cutoff was at 
571 deaths, in accordance with the cutoff of the primary analysis. All 
patients in the study provided written informed consent, as stated in 
the original publication3.

Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center CRC cohort. Somatic 
mutation data were downloaded from the cBioPortal for cancer genom-
ics (http://cbioportal.org/msk-impact) on 8 August 2017. All samples 
with ‘GeneralTumorType’ = ‘Colorectal Cancer’ were included (Sup-
plementary Table 1).

PDO cohort. PDOs were cultured from tumor biopsies of patients 
with mCRC, with approval of the Medical Ethical Committee of the 
Netherlands Cancer Institute. We used four KRASG12-mutated (SNS26: 
KRASG12S; TUM10: KRASG12V; TUM3: KRASG12A; TUM52: KRASG12C) and three 
KRASWT (TUM42, TUM50, TUM65) PDOs (Supplementary Table 9). The 
study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. 
All patients provided written informed consent for organoid culture 
and collection, analysis and pseudonymized sharing of clinical char-
acteristics for research purposes.

End points and study objectives
In the real-world discovery analysis, we searched for genome-wide 
somatic variants associated with OS and time on FTD/TPI treatment 
as end points. In the real-world validation analysis, the primary and 
secondary objectives were to assess the association of KRASG12 mutation 
status with OS and PFS, respectively, both in the population as a whole 
and in RAS/RAF mutation-based subpopulations. All end points used in 
the real-life analyses were measured from the start of FTD/TPI treatment 
and evaluated at participating institutions over the treatment course 
according to local practice. In our reanalysis of the RECOURSE trial, 
we tested OS benefit and PFS benefit of FTD/TPI versus placebo as the 
primary and secondary end points, respectively, in subgroups defined 
by codon-specific KRAS mutation status. This was in accordance with 
the hierarchy of end points prespecified in the RECOURSE trial proto-
col; these reanalyses were prespecified in a formal data request to the 
sponsor of the RECOURSE study before access to the data was granted.

Bioinformatics analysis
All genomics data of the discovery cohort was publicly available and 
provided by the HMF under the approved data request DR-015. WGS 
(median depths approximately 100 and approximately 40 for tumor and 
normal, respectively) and bioinformatics analysis of the discovery cohort 
were performed by the HMF as described previously17, with an optimized 
pipeline based on open-source tools freely available on GitHub (https://
github.com/hartwigmedical/pipeline5). Somatic genomic drivers were 
identified as an integrated functionality of PURPLE v.2.43 (ref. 17). Briefly, 
somatic mutations were considered drivers if they fulfilled one of the 
following criteria: (1) mutations in oncogenes located at—or within five 
bases of—known hotspots; (2) inframe indels in oncogenes with repeat 
count <8 repeats; (3) biallelic (that is, the WT allele is lost) nonsense, 
splice or indel variants in tumor suppressor genes (TSGs); and (4) muta-
tions in oncogenes or TSGs with a sample-specific driver likelihood >80%, 
as calculated by PURPLE as described previously17. For this manuscript, 
we only considered TSG mutations to be drivers if (1) they were biallelic 
or (2) in the case of multiple mutations in the gene for which the summed 
variant ploidies exceeded the gene ploidy within the sample −0.5 (for 
example, the classical APC two-hit hypothesis). Amplifications were 
considered to be drivers if (1) they affected an oncogene with pan-cancer 
evidence for recurrent amplification17 and (2) this oncogene had a copy 
number exceeding three times the sample ploidy. Deletions were con-
sidered to be drivers if (1) they affected TSGs with pan-cancer evidence 
for recurrent deletion17 and (2) they were homozygous (absolute gene 
copy number <0.5).

Statistical analysis
Median time on treatment, OS and PFS were calculated using 
the Kaplan–Meier method. OS and time on treatment were com-
pared between biomarker positive versus negative patients in the 
discovery cohort using the exact log-rank test. In this analysis, 
multiple-hypothesis correction was performed using the Benjamini–
Hochberg procedure. HRs and corresponding 95% CIs, and Wald 
test-based two-sided P values, were estimated from Cox regression 
models. The proportional-hazards assumption was tested using the 
methodology developed by Grambsch and Therneau25, with a signifi-
cance threshold of P = 0.05; categorical covariates were modeled as 
stratification factors (rather than covariates) where appropriate to 
prevent assumption violations. ‘Unadjusted’ Cox regression analyses 
of the real-world validation cohort were performed in a univariate 
manner. ‘Adjusted’ Cox regression analyses of the real-world valida-
tion cohort were stratified for ECOG performance status (0–1 versus 
≥2) and adjusted for seven additional covariates: time since diagnosis 
of first metastases (<18 versus ≥18 months); geographical region (UK 
versus Italy); age (<65 versus ≥65 years); sex; sidedness (left versus 
right); previous surgery (yes versus no); and peritoneal disease at 
the start of FTD/TPI treatment (yes versus no). For the RECOURSE

trial-based analyses, ‘unadjusted’ Cox regression was stratified for two 
stratification factors of the trial: time since diagnosis of first metastases 
(<18 versus ≥18 months) and geographical region ( Japan versus the 
USA, Europe and Australia). The third stratification factor of the trial, 
KRAS mutation status, was omitted because of high collinearity with 
our variables of interest (codon-specific KRAS status). For ‘adjusted’ 
RECOURSE trial-based analyses, we used stratified, multivariate Cox 
regression to adjust for eight prognostic factors on top of the two 
stratification factors used in the unadjusted analyses. These included: 
age (<65 versus ≥65 years); sex; ECOG performance status (0 versus 1); 
primary site of the disease (colon versus rectum); disease refractory to 
fluoropyrimidine as part of the last previous regimen (yes versus no); 
previous use of regorafenib; number of previous regimens (2, 3 or ≥4); 
and number of metastatic sites (1–2 versus ≥3). The rationale behind 
the selection of covariates for multivariate Cox regression is specified 
below. No subsequent covariate selection was performed; hence, all 
eight covariates plus the two stratification factors were included in all 
multivariate models of RECOURSE trial data. None of these variables 
were predictive of FTD/TPI benefit in the RECOURSE trial (P > 0.20 for 
all variables)3. Dose–response curves were fitted using Prism v.9.0.0 
(GraphPad Software) on log2-transformed FTD concentration values 
versus viability; the resulting fitted curves were then used to calculate 
IC50 values. Baseline characteristics were compared by Fisher’s exact 
test for categorical variables with two levels and by chi-squared test in 
the case of more than two levels. All reported P values are two-sided. In 
the main text and figures, all P values smaller than 0.001 were reported 
as <0.001. RECOURSE trial data-based survival analyses were per-
formed on the intention-to-treat population and were prespecified in 
a formal data request before access to the data was granted.

Candidate biomarker selection for the discovery cohort
The procedure for the selection of candidate biomarkers was as fol-
lows. Somatic genomic driver alterations (mutations and copy number 
alterations) were included as candidate biomarkers at increasingly 
specific ‘levels’: (1) gene-level biomarkers, for example, ‘APC altera-
tion’, which could either be by mutation or copy number alteration; 
(2) variant class-level biomarkers, for example, ‘APC mutation’ or ‘APC 
deletion’; (3) codon-level biomarkers, for example, ‘APC codon 1450 
mutation’; and (4) amino acid change-specific biomarkers, for example, 
‘APC p.Thr562Met mutation’. In cases where biomarkers of different 
levels showed complete redundancy, only the most specific level was 
included. For example, all KRAS alterations in the cohort were mutations 
leading to complete redundancy between ‘KRAS alteration’ and ‘KRAS 
mutation’. Hence, KRAS mutation was selected as the most specific level 
and included as a candidate biomarker, whereas KRAS alteration was 
excluded. All candidate biomarkers occurring in at least five patients 
in the discovery cohort were tested for association with treatment 
outcomes. Supplementary Table 3 provides a comprehensive overview 
of the frequencies of all candidate biomarkers identified in our cohort.

Variable selection for multivariate Cox regression
Real-world validation cohort. We selected eight variables for multi-
variate (adjusted) Cox proportional-hazards modeling of the real-world 
validation cohort. In this process, we aimed to harmonize the selection 
as much as possible to the variables used in the Cox regression modeling 
of the RECOURSE trial-based data (see below), with some alterations.

The ECOG performance status (0–1 versus ≥2) was used as a strati-
fication factor because this variable violated the proportional-hazards 
assumption when modeled as a covariate. Furthermore, we adjusted 
for seven additional covariates: time since diagnosis of first metasta-
ses (<18 versus ≥18 months); geographical region (UK versus Italy); 
age (<65 versus ≥65 years); sex; sidedness (left versus right); previous 
surgery (yes versus no); and peritoneal disease at the start of FTD/
TPI treatment (yes versus no). Sidedness was used instead of primary 
site of the disease (colon versus rectum, as used in the RECOURSE 

trial-based analyses), because sidedness was most strongly associated 
with OS and only one of these two variables could be included due to 
high collinearity. Due to data unavailability for the real-world valida-
tion cohort, we were unable to factor in if the disease was refractory 
to fluoropyrimidine as part of the last previous regimen, previous use 
of regorafenib, the number of previous regimens and the number of 
metastatic sites in the analyses. In RECOURSE trial-based analyses, 
none of these factors were predictive and only the latter variable was 
prognostic for OS. Instead, based on significant (univariate) associa-
tions with OS in the real-world validation cohort, we decided to add the 
two variables ‘previous surgery’ and ‘peritoneal disease at the start of 
FTD/TPI treatment’ to our selection of covariates, although these data 
were unavailable for the RECOURSE trial dataset.

RECOURSE trial-based analyses. We selected ten variables for multi-
variate (adjusted) Cox proportional-hazards modeling of RECOURSE 
trial data.

This selection included all factors prespecified in the RECOURSE 
trial study protocol, except KRAS status and ethnicity, totaling eight 
prespecified factors: time since diagnosis of first metastases (<18 
versus ≥18 months (stratification factor of the study); geographical 
region ( Japan versus the USA, Europe and Australia; stratification 
factor of the study); age (<65 versus ≥65 years); sex; ECOG perfor-
mance status (0 versus 1); primary site of the disease (colon versus 
rectum); number of previous regimens (2, 3 or ≥4); and number of 
metastatic sites (1–2 versus ≥3). KRAS status was excluded because of 
collinearity with our variables of interest (KRASG12 mutation, KRASG13 
mutation, KRASWT). Ethnicity was excluded for two reasons. First, the 
sponsor of the RECOURSE trial could not share the original ethnicity 
data for privacy reasons because the number of Black participants (nine 
patients) was below a predefined threshold put in place to prevent 
patient reidentification. For this reason, the ethnicity item has been 
modified to a quasi-identifier of ‘Asian’ versus ‘Other’ (White or Black). 
In the RECOURSE trial, the original ethnicity variable was not signifi-
cantly prognostic or predictive for OS3. Second, the modified ethnicity 
variable showed high collinearity (and hence redundancy) with the 
included factor ‘geographical region’ because 266 out of 266 (100%) 
of participants from the ‘Asia’ region had the ‘Asian’ ethnicity and 522 
out of 534 (98%) of participants from the USA, Europe and Australia 
regions had the ‘Other’ (which included Black and White) ethnicity.

Next, we included two additional factors in our multivariate 
models: (1) disease refractory to fluoropyrimidine as part of the last 
previous regimen; and (2) previous use of regorafenib. These factors 
were not prespecified in the RECOURSE trial protocol for multivariate 
analyses but were used for the subgroup analyses reported by Mayer 
et al.3. We decided to include these pretreatment-related factors in 
our multivariate models because patients with KRAS mutant tumors 
showed significant differences regarding their pretreatment profiles as 
compared to patients with KRASWT tumors. Patients with KRAS mutant 
tumors were more often refractory to fluoropyrimidine as part of their 
last previous regimen and were less heavily pretreated than patients 
with KRASWT (Table 2).

BRAF mutation status was not included in our selection because 
this information was missing for 676 out of 800 (85%) patients. Sub-
group analysis of the population with BRAF mutant tumors was not 
possible because BRAF mutations were detected in only eight patients.

Organoid and cell line cultures and drug assays
PDOs were cultured, expanded and assayed as described previ-
ously22. FTD (catalog no. S1778, Selleckchem) and 5-FU (catalog no. 
S1209, Selleckchem) were reconstituted in DMSO (catalog no. D2650, 
Sigma-Aldrich) at a stock concentration of 50 mM. PDOs were exposed 
to a two-step, eightfold dilution of FTD (range = 0.781–200 μM) for 
11 d or to 5-FU for 6 d in a two-step, eightfold dilution (range = 0.781–
200 μM). Culture medium and FTD were refreshed every 3–4 d.

The isogenic cell lines were assayed with FTD and 5-FU in a similar 
fashion, shortening the assay duration to 3 d. The used concentra-
tions were adjusted to include more data points of lower concentra-
tions (range = 0.1 nM, 0.5 nM, 1 μM, 2 μM, 5 μM, 10 μM, 20 μM, 50 μM, 
200 μM, 500 μM). The readout was performed using the MTT Assay Kit 
for Cell Proliferation (catalog no. ab211091, Abcam); culture medium 
was replaced with 100 μl of a 1:1 mix of MTT reagent with serum-free 
RPMI 1640 (catalog no. 21875034, Gibco), which was replaced by 150 μl 
MTT solvent after incubation, according to the manufacturer’s proto-
col. Then, absorbance was measured at OD590 nM on an Infinite 200 Pro 
plate reader (Tecan Life Sciences).

Isogenic cell line construction: Colo320 KRASG12D knock in
Single-guide RNA oligonucleotide sequences were designed on 
Chop-Chop (http://chopchop.cbu.uib.no/#). CRISPR–Cas9 CRISPR 
RNA (crRNA) (5′-CUUGUGGUAGUUGGAGCUGG-3′) and trans-activating 
crRNA (tracrRNA) (catalog no. 1072532), Cas9 Nuclease V3 (catalog 
no. 1081058) and HDR Donor Oligo (5′-ATTCTGAATTAGCTGTATCGT-
CAAGGCACTCTTGCCTACGCCGTCAGCTCCCACTACCACAAGTT-
TATATTCAGTCATTTTCAGC-3′) were purchased from Integrated DNA 
Technologies. Briefly, guide RNA (gRNA) complexes were formed as 
described previously26 by combining equal amounts of crRNA (160 μM 
in stock) and tracrRNA (160 μM in stock) in Duplex Buffer (cat no. 11-01-
03-01, Integrated DNA Technologies) and heating the oligonucleotides 
to 95 °C, followed by slowly cooling to room temperature. Cas9 nucle-
ase was then added (the molar ratio of crRNA:Cas9 nuclease was 1:0.5) 
to the gRNA complexes, followed by 15-min incubation at room tem-
perature. The Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (ctRNP) complexes were then 
stored on ice until use. DNA HDR templates were prepared by diluting 
the HDR Donor Oligo stock to 10 μM in nuclease-free water. Electropo-
ration was performed by using the 4D-Nucleofector X Unit (catalog no. 
AAF-1003X, Lonza) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For 
each sample, 2 × 105 cells were resuspended in Ingenio Electroporation 
Solution (catalog no. MIR 50111, Mirus Bio). Per reaction, 2.5 μM ctRNP 
and 0.5 μM HDR template were added to the cell suspension. We next 
pipetted 20 μl of each sample into individual wells of 16-well Nucle-
ocuvette Strips (catalog no. AXP-1004, Lonza) and ran the program 
CM-137. After electroporation, cells were sorted by FACS and single 
cells were cultured in 96-well plates for up to two weeks. For single-cell 
clones, the presence of the KRASG12D mutation was then confirmed by 
Sanger sequencing.

Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was performed on the isogenic cell lines and 
PDOs treated with FTD or 5-FU, at different concentrations, for 24 h 
(cell lines) or 48 h (PDOs). For PDOs (but not for the isogenic cell lines), 
the extracellular matrix was removed by incubating with 2 mg ml−1 type 
II dispase (catalog no. D4693, Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells 
were washed with PBS and lysed in RIPA Lysis and Extraction Buffer 
(catalog no. 89901, Thermo Fisher Scientific), supplemented with 

Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (catalog no. 78420, Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) and Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (catalog no. 87786, 
Thermo Fisher Scientific). Protein concentration was determined 
using Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (catalog no. 1610803, Bio-Rad 
Laboratories). Protein samples were run on NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris 
Gels (catalog no. NP0323BOX, Thermo Fisher Scientific), transfer 
was performed using the iBlot 2 Gel Transfer Device (catalog no. 
IB21001, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and compatible iBlot Transfer 
Stack; nitrocellulose (catalog no. IB301002, Thermo Fisher Scientific) 
membranes were used. Membranes were blocked in 5% BSA (catalog 
no. 10735094001, Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS plus 0.2% Tween-20 (cata-
log no. P1379-1L, Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h, then incubated with primary 
antibodies in 5% BSA in PBS and Tween-20. As primary antibodies, 
we used anti-phospho-Histone H2A.X (Ser139, catalog no. 05-636, 
Sigma-Aldrich) and anti-HSP 90α/β (catalog no. sc-13119, Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology), which were diluted 1:1,000 in PBS with 5% BSA. The 
secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG, HRP-linked antibody, catalog 
no. 7076, Cell Signaling Technology) was diluted 1:1,000 in 5% BSA in 
PBS and Tween-20. The blots were incubated with Clarity Max Western 
ECL Substrate (catalog no. 1705062, Bio-Rad Laboratories) and the 
luminescence signal was imaged using the ChemiDoc Imaging System 
(catalog no. 17001401, Bio-Rad Laboratories).

Colony formation assay
Cells were seeded into six-well plates (1.5–2 × 104 cells per well) and 
cultured in the presence of drugs at the indicated concentrations. For 
each cell line, cells cultured using different conditions were fixed in 
methanol (catalog no. 32213, Honeywell) and stained with 0.1% crystal 
violet solution (catalog no. V5265, Sigma-Aldrich).

Policy information about studies involving human research participants and Sex and Gender in Research. 

Reporting on sex and gender Throughout the manuscript, we report sex as an biological attribute, which was collected through self reporting. Sharing of 
patient-level, pseudonymized clinical data, including sex, for research purposes was covered by the informed consents of the 
individual studies and local legislation.

Population characteristics Discovery cohort HMF 
Patients with advanced or metastatic cancer for whom there is an indication for any systemic treatment were included in the 
HMF database as part of the CPCT-02 (NCT01855477) clinical study. We included all patients in the HMF database who 
received FTD/TPI as part of their standard-of-care treatment for advanced/metastatic, histologically proven, colorectal 
carcinoma, which were identified in the HMF database in May 2018. The median age was 62 years (IQR 59-68), 38% was 
(self-reported) female and 62% male, and the percentage of patients with KRAS G12 and other KRAS mutations were 54% 
and 11%, respectively. All patients received FTD/TPI treatment as part of standard-of-care. As FTD/TPI is approved as final 
line therapy, these were all late-stage patients. 
 
Real-World Cohort (UK and Italy) 
Retrospective collection of all sequential patients with advanced/metastatic, histologically proven, colorectal carcinoma 
undergoing treatment with FTD/TPI following progression to prior lines of standard chemotherapy, with known codon- 
specific RAS/RAF status known between November 2016 and March 2022. As reported in Table 1, the median age was 64 
years (IQR 56-71), 41% was (self-reported) female and 59% male, 72% and 28% were diagnosed with colon and rectum 
cancer, respectively, and the percentage of patients with KRAS G12, KRAS G13, KRAS other, NRAS and BRAF mutations were 
36%, 9.0%, 5.5%, 6.4%, and 3.3%, respectively. All patients received FTD/TPI treatment as part of standard-of-care. As FTD/
TPI is approved as final line therapy, these were all late-stage patients. 
 
RECOURSE trial (population description from the original publication, by Mayer et al, NEJM 2015) 
"Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were well balanced between the two study groups (Table 1). All the 
patients had received prior chemotherapy regimens containing a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan; all but one 
patient (in the placebo group) had received bevacizumab. All but two patients (one patient in each study group) with KRAS 
wild-type tumors had received cetuximab or panitumumab. Regorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor, became available for 
the management of previously treated colorectal cancer during the course of the study; 17% of the patients in the TAS-102 
group, as compared with 20% of those in the placebo group, had received this drug. A large percentage of patients in both 
study groups — 93% of patients receiving TAS-102 and 90% of those receiving placebo — had disease that had been 
refractory to fluoropyrimidines when they were last exposed to this class of drugs. Moreover, 58% of the patients receiving 
TAS-102 and 54% of the patients receiving placebo had disease that had been refractory to fluoropyrimidine when that drug 
was administered as part of their last treatment regimen before study entry." 
 
"Patients with biopsy-documented adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum were eligible for participation in the study if they 
had received at least two prior regimens of standard chemotherapies, which could have included adjuvant chemotherapy if a 
tumor had recurred within 6 months after the last administration of this therapy; if they had either tumor progression within 
3 months after the last administration of chemotherapy; or if they had had clinically significant adverse events from standard 
chemotherapies that precluded the readministration of those therapies. Eligibility also required knowledge of tumor status 
with regard to KRAS (i.e., wild-type or mutant), as reported by investigators. Patients were also required to have received 
chemotherapy with each of the following agents: a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, bevacizumab, and — for patients 
with KRAS wild-type tumors — cetuximab or panitumumab. In addition, patients had to be 18 years of age or older; have 
adequate bone-marrow, liver, and renal function; and have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance

status of 0 or 1 (on a scale of 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no symptoms, 1 indicating mild symptoms, and higher numbers 
indicating increasing degrees of disability)."

Recruitment Discovery cohort HMF 
Patients with advanced or metastatic cancer for whom there is an indication for any systemic treatment were included in the 
HMF database as part of the CPCT-02 (NCT01855477) clinical study. The CPCT-02 study, patients were included by 41 
academic, teaching and general hospitals across The Netherlands and collected material and clinical data by standardized 
protocols. Metastatic cancer patients were asked to participate in the studies in any of the 41 participating hospitals. 
Recruitment involved hundreds of medical specialists and research nurses which minimizes self-selection biases. Recruitment 
was independent on tumor type. An important requirement for participation was the ability to safely undergo a tumor 
biopsy. Health conditions and lesion site related risk could therefore have resulted in exclusion of patients. 
 
Real-world validation cohort 
As per above 
 
RECOURSE trial (recruitment details from the original publication, by Mayer et al, NEJM 2015) 
"Between June 17, 2012, and October 8, 2013, a total of 1002 patients were screened for eligibility, of whom 800 underwent 
randomization, with 534 assigned to receive TAS-102 and 266 assigned to receive placebo (intention-to-treat population) 
(details regarding the disposition of patients are provided in Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org). 
Treatment was initiated in 798 patients, with 533 receiving TAS-102 and 265 receiving placebo (safety-analysis population). 
All treated patients received their assigned study drug according to the randomization schema, and 760 could be evaluated 
for assessment of tumor response (tumor-response population)."

Ethics oversight HMF discovery cohort 
The study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the University Medical Center Utrecht and was conducted in 
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent for collection, analysis and 
pseudonymized sharing paired tumor-normal whole genome sequencing data and clinical characteristics for research 
purposes. 
 
Real-world validation cohort 
For patients included from the UK, the study built on a UK National Audit (Stavraka et al. Clin Colorectal Cancer. 2021 
Dec;20(4):342-349) and data were handled in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Formal ethical approval for data 
collection, analysis and pseudonymized sharing for research purposes was covered by UK Health Research Authority guidance 
(NHS Health Research Authority. Service Evaluation Clinical/Non Financial Audit Usual Practice [in Public Health Including 
Health Protection]. London: NHRA). For patients included in Italy, data collection, analysis and pseudonymized sharing for 
research purposes was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Fondazione IRCCS Ca’ Granda Ospedale Maggiore 
Policlinico, Milano, Italy and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 
RECOURSE trial (from the original publication, by Mayer et al, NEJM, 2015) 
"The review board at each participating institution approved the study, which was conducted according to the principles of 
the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All patients 
provided written informed consent." 
 
Patient-derived organoid (PDO) cohort 
The study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the Netherlands Cancer Institute and was conducted in 
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent for organoid culture and 
collection, analysis and pseudonymized sharing of clinical characteristics for research purposes. 

Note that full information on the approval of the study protocol must also be provided in the manuscript.

Replication The main finding of the manuscript that KRAS G12 mutations are associated with reduced OS in patients with mCRC upon treatment with FTD/
TPI was found in a discovery cohort, replicated in a large real-world cohort and in the RECOURSE trial. The RECOURSE trial-based analysis 
showed that this was based on a predictive effect. This RECOURSE trial-based analysis was prespecified in a formal data request before access 
to the data was granted, which minimizes potential biases. The finding that KRAS G13 patients have improved OS upon treatment with FTD/
TPI was discovered in the large real-world cohort, as these patients were absent in the smaller discovery cohort. This finding was then 
replicated with re-analysis of the RECOURSE trial (also pre-specified in our formal data request), which showed that this was based on a 
predictive effect. 
 
In vitro results: 
The colony formation assays (Figure 4A-B) were independently repeated three times with similar results. 
FTD/TPI sensitivity testing of isogenic cells lines (Figure 4C-D) was independently repeated four times with similar results. 
FTD/TPI sensitivity testing of KRAS wild type organoid lines (Figure 4E-F) was independently repeated three times with similar results. 
FTD/TPI sensitivity testing of KRAS G12 mutant organoid lines (Figure 4E-F) was independently repeated four times with similar results. 
Western blot analysis of SW48 isogenic cell lines (Figure 4G) was independently repeated three times with similar results. 
Western blot analysis of Colo320 isogenic cell lines (Figure 4G) was independently repeated two times with similar results. 
5-FU sensitivity testing of isogenic cells lines (Figure 4I-J) was independently repeated three times with similar results. 
5-FU sensitivity testing of organoids (Figure 4K-L) was independently repeated three times with similar results. 

Randomization Experimental subgroups were either determined by KRAS codon-specific mutation status, a non-random procedure, or (in the RECOURSE trial) 
by treatment status (FTD/TPI vs placebo), a random procedure. In the real-world cohort-based analyses, we reported subgroup-specific 
differences in baseline characteristics in the main text and Table 1, and adjusted for these differences using multivariate Cox regression. In the 
RECOURSE trial-based analyses, we reported subgroup-specific differences in baseline characteristics in the main text and Table 2, and 
adjusted for these differences using multivariate Cox regression. Furthermore, we specifically compared the KRAS G12 mutant subgroup with 
the other RAS/RAF mutant subgroup, which were two subgroups with very similar baseline characteristics (see Table 1 and Table 2).

Blinding Discovery cohort HMF 
Collection of genomics data and bioinformatics analysis were performed prospectively and hence blinded for clinical outcomes. Collection of 
clinical outcomes was performed by trained research nurses and medical doctors at the sites of inclusion, who were blinded, as they lacked 
knowledge about the research question of our study. Data analysis happened in an unblinded fashion. 
 
Real-world Cohort (UK and Italy) 
Collection of clinical outcomes was performed by trained research nurses and medical doctors at the sites of inclusion, who were blinded, as 
they lacked knowledge about the research question of our study. Data analysis happened in an unblinded fashion. 
 
RECOURSE trial 
The RECOURSE trial was a double-blind study. Details on this process can be found in the original publication (Mayer et al, NEJM 2015). In this 
re-analysis, data analysis was prespecified in a formal and detailed data request before access to the data was granted, but happened in an 
unblinded fashion. 
 
In vitro experimentation occurred in an unblinded fashion, as the experimenters generated the appropriate models for their experiments, but 
given standardized procedures for data readout (automated cell viability readouts and Western blotting) the risk of potential biases was 
limited.

Outcomes In the real-world discovery analysis, we searched for genome-wide somatic variants associated with OS and time on FTD/TPI 

treatment as endpoints. In the real-world validation analysis, the primary and secondary objective was to assess the association of 
KRAS G12 mutation with OS and PFS, respectively, in the population as a whole and in RAS/RAF mutation-based subpopulations. All 
endpoints used in real-life analyses were measured from start of FTD/TPI treatment and evaluated at participating institutions over 
the treatment course according to local practice. In our re-analysis of the RECOURSE trial, we tested OS and PFS benefit of FTD/TPI vs 
placebo as primary and secondary endpoints, respectively, in subgroups defined by codon-specific KRAS mutation status. This was in 
accordance with the hierarchy of endpoints prespecified in the RECOURSE trial protocol and these re-analyses were prespecified in a 
formal data request to the sponsor of the RECOURSE study before access to the data was granted.
