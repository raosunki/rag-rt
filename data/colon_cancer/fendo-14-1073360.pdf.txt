Background: Current studies on the establishment of prognostic models for

colon cancer with lung metastasis (CCLM) were lacking. This study aimed to

construct and validate prediction models of overall survival (OS) and cancer-

specific survival (CSS) probability in CCLM patients.

Method:Data on 1,284 patients with CCLMwere collected from the Surveillance,

Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Patients were randomly

assigned with 7:3 (stratified by survival time) to a development set and a

validation set on the basis of computer-calculated random numbers. After

screening the predictors by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator

(LASSO) and multivariate Cox regression, the suitable predictors were entered

into Cox proportional hazard models to build prediction models. Calibration

curves, concordance index (C-index), time-dependent receiver operating

characteristic (ROC) curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to

perform the validation of models. Based onmodel-predicted risk scores, patients

were divided into low-risk and high-risk groups. The Kaplan–Meier (K-M) plots

and log-rank test were applied to perform survival analysis between the two

groups.

Results: Building upon the LASSO and multivariate Cox regression, six variables

were significantly associated with OS and CSS (i.e., tumor grade, AJCC T stage,

AJCC N stage, chemotherapy, CEA, liver metastasis). In development, validation,

and expanded testing sets, AUCs and C-indexes of the OS and CSS prediction

models were all greater than or near 0.7, which indicated excellent predictability

of models. On the whole, the calibration curves coincided with the diagonal in

two models. DCA indicated that the models had higher clinical benefit than any

single risk factor. Survival analysis results showed that the prognosis was worse in

the high-risk group than in the low-risk group, which suggested that the models

had significant discrimination for patients with different prognoses.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) has been reported as a threat to human

health worldwide and a burden to society and families (1). In the

past 30 years, the global prevalence of CRC was in the rising trend

year after year and the morbidity and mortality have doubled or

more than doubled in a dozen or so world regions (2). According to

the statistics of global cancer released by GLOBALCAN in 2020, the

incidence of CRC in both sexes was in the third rank and the

mortality was in the second rank (3). In countries with a middle and

high human development index (HDI), the increase of morbidity

and mortality especially was in the young population, which was

related to smoking, alcohol consumption, low calcium and fiber

diets, obesity, and physical inactivity (4).

At present, CRC was seen as a whole cohort to analyze the

prognostic factors in many studies (5–7). However, colon and rectal

cancers differ in incidence, mortality, and patterns of distant

metastasis. Evidence has shown that the incidence of colon cancer

(CC) is higher than that of rectal cancer. The clinical prognosis and

distant metastasis preference in CC patients were also different with

rectal cancer (8, 9). Therefore, it was necessary to deem CC patients

as a unique subset to further study. Among all distant metastases of

CC, the presence rate of lung metastatic sites accounted for around

30%, second only to liver metastases (8). Furthermore, a systematic

pan-cancer analysis revealed that colon cancer ranked first in the

distribution of primary cancer in cases with pulmonary metastasis

(10). Universally known, distant organ metastatic spread could

contribute to poorer prognosis for CC patients (11). Unless it

could be surgically removed, the prognosis for colon cancer with

lung metastases (CCLM) was poor (12). At present, the American

Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor node metastasis (TNM)

stage system was broadly applied for prognosis prediction of CCLM

patients (13). Nevertheless, with the effects on prognosis of other

clinical risk factors (e.g., age, tumor grade, and chemotherapy), the

AJCC TNM stage system could not provide personalized prognostic

reference of CCLM patients well. Therefore, it was necessary to

evaluate the prognostic factors and construct prediction models for

patients with CCLM.

In this study, we collected a large amount of clinical data of

CCLM from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results

(SEER) database. By the retrospective analysis for these data, we

constructed and validated the 1-, 3-, 5-year overall survival and

cancer-specific survival prediction models. It will provide new ideas

and help for the clinical personalized prognostic evaluation

of CCLM.
Materials and methods

Patients

The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)

database was an open-access cancer database covering around

30% of the United States (US) population, which recorded

information about cancer incidence, treatment, and survival (14).

The data of patients diagnosed with colon cancer with lung

metastasis (CCLM) were collected from the SEER database using

SEER*Stat software (version 8.4.0; https://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/ ).

Patients with CCLM were identified using site record ICD-O-3/

WHO 2008 = ‘Colon excluding Rectum’ and SEER Combined Mets

at DX-lung (2010+) = ‘Yes’. The data of the CC-related variables were

downloaded from the database “Incidence - SEER Research Plus

Data, 18 Registries, Nov 2020 Sub (2000–2018)” (i.e., age, sex, race,

primary site, tumor grade, AJCC T stage, AJCC N stage,

radiotherapy, chemotherapy, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA),

marital status, tumor size, bone metastasis, brain metastasis, liver

metastasis, total number of in situ/malignant tumors for patient,

surgery of primary sites, surgery of distant lymph nodes or other

tissues or organs beyond the primary sites, histologic type, survival

months, overall survival status, and cancer-specific survival status).

Patients with age <18 years, survival months = 0, or unclear or

missing relevant clinical information were excluded from the analysis.

All patients were randomly assigned 7:3 to a development set and a

validation set on the basis of computer-calculated random numbers.

Randomization was stratified by survival time (15). The flowchart of

the patients screening is shown in Figure 1.

Development and validation
of prediction models

The study was a population-based retrospective cohort study.

Number and percentage (N, %) were used to describe the categorical

data, and chi-square test was used to compare the difference between

development and validation sets. According to the previous relevant

studies and clinical experience (7, 12, 16), 18 independent variables

were considered as candidate predictors, including age, sex, race,

primary site, tumor grade, AJCC T stage, AJCC N stage,

radiotherapy, chemotherapy, CEA, marital status, tumor size, bone

metastasis, brain metastasis, liver metastasis, tumor number, surgery

sites, and histologic type. Among them, the predictor “surgery sites”

was defined according to the surgery of primary sites and distant

lymph nodes or other tissues or organs beyond the primary sites. The

least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression

analysis was employed to screen out suitable prognostic predictors

from these 18 clinical variables (17). Multivariable Cox regression

analysis was used to determine whether the selected variables were

significantly colon-cancer-associated, and then the predictors with P

< 0.05 were entered into Cox proportional hazard models to

construct prediction models in CCLM patients, presented as the

nomograms (18). The prediction outcomes were 1-, 3-, and 5-year

overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) probability.

The time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC)

curves and concordance index (C-index) were used to evaluate the
Frontiers in Endocrinology 03
predictability of the models. The areas under ROC curves (AUCs)

and C-index ranged from 0.5 to 1, and the values over 0.7 indicated

nice predictability. Calibration curve plots were used to assess the

difference degree between the predicted and actual risks. Decision

curve analysis (DCA) was performed to evaluate the clinical benefit

and utility of the constructed prediction models. Furthermore, we

divided all the patients into low-risk and high-risk levels according

to the model-predicted risk score. The patients with a risk score

higher than the median were assigned into the high-risk group, and

the rest were assigned into the low-risk group. The Kaplan–Meier

(K-M) plots and log-rank test were used to perform survival

analysis to compare the survival difference between the two

groups. The hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI)

was calculated. It was regarded as a significant difference when P-

value < 0.05. All the statistical analysis was in R software (version

4.2.1; https://www.r-project.org/) with the “rms,” “glmnet,”

“survival,” “survminer,” “timeROC,” and “ggDCA” packages.
Results

Baseline characteristics

The clinical characteristics of all the patients are shown in

Table 1. A total of 1,284 patients between 2010 and 2015 with

CCLM were included in our study, 898 of which were in the

development set and the others were in the validation set. The

chi-square test showed no significant difference between all the

variables in the development and validation sets except primary site

and liver metastasis (P < 0.05). Among all patients, 50.5% were

older than 65 years, 51.1% were men, and 71.8% were white people.

For the tumor primary sites, 17.4% patients were in the ascending

colon, 9.1% in the transverse colon, 6.6% in the descending colon,

32.3% in the sigmoid colon, and 34.5% in other sites (i.e., cecum,

appendix, hepatic flexure of colon, splenic flexure of colon, and

overlapping lesion of colon). In all 1,284 individuals, 915 (71.3%)

underwent chemotherapy and 75 (5.8%) underwent radiotherapy.

Furthermore, the median time of the entire cohort was 17 months

(interquartile range [IQR], 6–32 months), the OS rate through the

ending of follow-up was 11.7%, and the CSS rate was 17.4%.

Based on the presence or absence of extrapulmonary metastases

to the bone, brain, and liver, we divided all patients into two

cohorts, CCLM without extrapulmonary metastases (n = 418) and

CCLM with extrapulmonary metastases (n = 866). We compared

the differences in clinicopathological characteristics and treatment

options between the two cohorts, as shown in Supplementary Table

S1. Patients with extrapulmonary metastatic sites tended to have an

N2 stage and a positive CEA serum level. In addition, more patients

with extrapulmonary metastatic sites underwent radiotherapy and

resection of non-primary sites.
Development of prediction models

There were 18 independent candidate variables (Table 1)

included in the LASSO regression model (Figures 2A, C). When

the partial-likelihood deviance was the lowest, 15 and 14 variables

were prognostic factors for OS and CSS, respectively. For getting

simpler, more interpretable models, we used the log (l) values

chosen by one standard error of the minimum criteria and selected

the variables with non-zero coefficients. Finally, we selected six

predictors (i.e., tumor grade, AJCC T stage, AJCC N stage,

chemotherapy, CEA, liver metastasis) in the multivariable Cox

regression analysis for OS and CSS (Figures 2B, D). The predictor

was identified as a risk factor for death when the corresponding

coefficient was >0 or when the HR value was significantly >1 or,

conversely, as a protective factor. Based on the multivariable Cox

regression for OS, tumor grade (b = 0.48; HR = 1.62), AJCC T stage,

(b = 0.30; HR = 1.35), AJCC N stage (b = 0.26; HR = 1.30),

chemotherapy (b = -1.01; HR = 0.37), CEA (b = 0.25; HR = 1.28),

and liver metastasis (b = 0.58; HR = 1.79) were deemed to be

significantly associated with the OS in the development set. Based

on the multivariable Cox regression for CSS, tumor grade (b = 0.46;

HR = 1.59), AJCC T stage, (b = 0.31; HR = 1.36), AJCC N stage (b =

0.32; HR = 1.38), chemotherapy (b = -0.98; HR = 0.38), CEA (b =

0.26; HR = 1.30), and liver metastasis (b = 0.60; HR = 1.82) were

deemed to be significantly associated with the CSS in the
Frontiers in Endocrinology 05
development set (Table 2). These significant variables above were

incorporated into the final 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS and CSS prediction

models, shown as nomograms (Figures 3A, B).
Validation of prediction models

The C-index of the OS prediction model was 0.685 (95% CI,

0.664–0.705) in the development set and 0.716 (95% CI, 0.686–

0.745) in the validation set. Meanwhile, the C-index of the CSS

prediction model was 0.688 (95% CI, 0.666–0.710) in the

development set and 0.713 (95% CI, 0.682–0.743) in the

validation set. The calibration curve plots of two prognosis

prediction models revealed an excellent agreement between the

predicted and actual risks (Figures 4, 5). The time-dependent ROC

curves were used to compare the predictive performance of each

prognostic factor and prediction model, which showed higher

predictability of two models than any independent factor, with

the 1-, 3-, and 5-year AUCs for the OS prediction model of 0.751

(95% CI, 0.719–0.784), 0.752 (95% CI, 0.714–0.789), and 0.775

0.745–0.922) in the validation set (Figure 7B). Furthermore, the

results of DCA also indicated better clinical applicability of two

prediction models than any single risk factor (Figures 8, 9).

Survival analysis

We calculated the risk score for all patients according to the

constructed prediction models, and the patients were divided into

low-risk and high-risk groups according to the median risk score. The

statistical analysis for all-cause and cancer-specific mortality revealed

higher levels in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group (all-

cause mortality: low-risk vs. high risk, 82.4% vs. 94.8%, P < 0.0001;

cancer-specific mortality: low-risk vs. high risk, 76.7% vs. 88.9%, P <

0.0001; Figures 10A, C). Supplementary Table S2 shows the statistics of

survival status at the end of follow-up, which revealed that the high-risk

group had a higher mortality in almost each subgroup stratified by

tumor grade, AJCC T stage, AJCC N stage, chemotherapy, CEA, and

liver metastasis. The K-M plots and log-rank test also showed the worse

OS and CSS conditions in the high-risk group than in the low-risk

group (P < 0.0001, Figures 10B, D); furthermore, we conducted

subgroup K-M analysis between low-risk and high-risk groups after

stratifying by risk factors, still indicating a worse survival in the high-

risk group (Supplementary Table S3). We noted that the overall cohort

had a favorable response to chemotherapy (OS, HR = 2.24; 95% CI,

1.98–2.54; CSS, HR = 2.27; 95% CI, 2.00–2.58; Figure 11A). Survival

analysis showed that more extrapulmonary metastatic sites indicated

poorer prognosis, graphically displayed in Figure 11B. Based on

the extent of extrapulmonary metastases, we performed the

subgroup analysis to evaluate the enhanced effect of chemotherapy in

survival. Among CCLM patients with or without extrapulmonary

metastases, chemotherapy could provide a good prognostic

opportunity (Figure 11C).
Expanded validation of prediction models

We redownloaded the data of patients with complete tumor

grade, AJCC T stage, AJCC N stage, chemotherapy, CEA, and liver

metastasis information from the SEER database as an expanded
Frontiers in Endocrinology 08
testing set (n = 3115; Supplementary Table S4). The C-indexes of

OS and CSS prediction models were 0.671 (95% CI, 0.665–0.677)

and 0.672 (95% CI, 0.666–0.678), respectively. Calibration plots for

two models showed good consistency between the predicted and

actual risks (Supplementary Figure S1). The time-dependent ROC

curves of two models were over the curves of each single prognostic

factor (Supplementary Figure S2). Also, DCA still indicated that

two models could yield more ideal clinical benefits than a single

prognostic factor (Supplementary Figure S3). The statistics of

survival status showed different all-cause and cancer-specific

mortalities between high-risk and low-risk groups (P < 0.0001),

and survival analysis also suggested the difference of survival

patterns between these two groups (P < 0.0001), as shown in

Supplementary Figure S4.
Discussion

Previous studies investigated prognostic factors and constructed

prediction models for colon cancer with distant organ metastases

(5, 6, 19). However, the study on the establishment of prognostic

models for CCLM was lacking. To explore the prognosis of the

unique CCLM subset patients, we performed the identification of

prognostic risk factors and development of prediction models in

this study to provide valuable guidance for clinical prognosis

estimation and individualized administration of patients

with CCLM.

In this study, we established prediction models for the 1-, 3-,

and 5-year prognosis of CCLM based on a mass of clinical samples
Frontiers in Endocrinology 09
from the SEER database. Six parameters (i.e., tumor grade, AJCC T

stage, AJCC N stage, chemotherapy, CEA, liver metastasis),

significantly associated with the OS and CSS of CCLM patients,

were incorporated as independent prognostic factors. The analysis

showed that patients in tumor grades III–IV had a 62% increased

risk of overall death (HR, 1.62) and a nearly 60% increased risk of

cancer-specific death (HR, 1.59), in comparison with patients in I–

II tumor grades. According to the results of LASSO regression
Frontiers in Endocrinology 10
analysis, we excluded the parameter “tumor size,” which probably

has certain collinearity with “AJCC T stage.” Furthermore, lymph

node metastasis was the common form of CC metastasis. Previous

studies had proved that the higher N stage indicated the worse

prognosis in metastatic CC patients (20, 21). Similarly, CCLM

patients in the N2 stage had worse prognosis than in the N0–N1

stages based on our analysis. Population and evidence had shown

that chemotherapy could provide metastasis CC patients with

survival advantage (22, 23). On the strength of our analysis,

chemotherapy was also considered to be critical for improving

CCLM patients’ prognosis; furthermore, it could be conducive to

significantly enhance survival in the subgroup population of CCLM

with extrapulmonary metastases. However, chemotherapeutics

could produce additional toxicity (e.g., neurotoxicity) to bring

about a lot of adverse effects for patients; not all patients would

derive good benefit. Thus, consideration of each patient’s specific
Frontiers in Endocrinology 11
clinical fact was important in decision of using adjuvant therapy for

CC (22, 24, 25). Meanwhile, Liu et al. mentioned that a study

reported that CC patients could gain benefits through adjuvant

radical treatment; however, “radiotherapy” was excluded based on

LASSO regression analysis (26). Probably, also as an adjunctive

therapy, “radiotherapy”may have collinearity with “chemotherapy”

(27). In our study, CEA positive was also a prognostic risk factor in

CCLM patients. The elevated preoperative level of CEA had an

intimate relationship with bad tumor stage and impaired the

patient’s surgical benefit profile, leading to the shortened 5-year

survival rates (28, 29). The return to normal levels of serum CEA

after lung metastasectomy usually indicated a better prognosis;

Ma et al. 10.3389/fendo.2023.1073360
hence, close monitoring of CEA levels was quite important for the

postoperative management of patients. As the most common form

of distant metastasis in CC, liver metastases can increase the risk of

death in patients (26). Similarly, liver metastasis was identified as a

risk factor for CCLM in our study; however, bone metastasis and

brain metastasis were not identified as risk factors, which may be

due to the low proportion of patients with bone or brain metastases

in the current cohort. In addition, 67.4% of CC patients with

pulmonary metastases at diagnosis will have other simultaneous

metastatic sites to the liver, bone, and brain. Hence, it is essential to

screen for these sites in the clinic.

Based on the results of the model validation, all the C-indexes and

AUCs were more than or close to 0.7 and the proximity of calibration

curves for models to the diagonal was excellent, indicating that the

models had excellent predictability and accuracy. All the ROC curves

of single prognostic factors were under curves of the constructed

prediction models, which showed that models had better

predictability than any independent risk factor. Furthermore, DCA

was recommended in many leading medical journals including

Lancet Oncology, BMJ, and PLOS Medicine (30). Therefore, DCA

was performed in this study, and the results indicated that prediction

models could yield higher clinical benefits than any single risk factor.

Of note, there were significant differences in the primary site

distribution and liver metastasis between the development and

validation sets. This might be the reason why the predictability,

accuracy, and clinical benefits of models in the validation set are

slightly worse than those in the development set but still were

satisfactory. On the risk scores calculated by prediction models, we

divided the entire cohort into low-risk and high-risk groups. In the

entire cohort, the all-cause and cancer-specific mortalities of patients

in the high-risk group were 12.4% and 12.2% more than in the low-

risk group, respectively. Most of subgroup analyses after stratifying by

risk factor also suggested that the mortality in the high-risk group was

higher than in the low-risk group. Additionally, the K-M survival

analysis of all cases indicated that the low-risk group had a better

prognosis than the high-risk group. Stratified by different risk factors,

the prognosis of patients between the two groups was compared by

subgroup analyses. The results still did not change, suggesting that

models had significant discrimination for patients with different risks

in the 1-, 3-, and 5-year prognoses. Furthermore, we collected an

expanded testing set with 3,115 CCLM patients from the SEER

database and model validation in this set still showed

satisfactory results.

Nomogram was used to show and apply our prediction models

as a convenient form to predict various clinical outcomes, providing

better guidance for CCLM-individualized medical judgement and

decision-making (31). Also, all the prognostic factors identified in

our study were easily available in clinical practice, allowing for the

more convenient operation and application. Currently, Huang et al.,

Li et al., and Wang et al. have developed similar prognostic models,

focusing on the overall cohort of CRC or the cohort of CCLM

without liver metastasis (32–34); however, our models are specific

for the prognostic evaluation of unique CCLM subset patients.

Meanwhile, we categorized the SEER database data as a
Frontiers in Endocrinology 12
development set and a validation set using stratified

randomization, which could prevent imbalance between two

groups for known factors that influence prognosis. Unlike prior

studies, model validation was performed using the independent

validation dataset that was not applied to train models, allowing for

more effective testing of the performance of the model.

There were still some shortcomings in the present study. First, a

mass of data with missing or unclear information were excluded,

exacerbating the risk of selection bias. Surgery was a recognized

protective factor, and the resection of the primary and metastatic

lesions in patients with metastatic CC results in 5-year survival rates

of 20%–50% (35). However, almost all patients (99.8%) underwent

surgery in the present study. We did not evaluate the association

between survival and whether surgery was performed, without

obtaining the patients’ data with surgery difference from the

SEER database. This was probably because the data were excluded

in the data preprocessing. Further data and studies were needed to

explore this point and cover the current shortage. Second, some

important information was not recorded in the SEER database,

including secondary tumor size, number, and depth of invasion of

the metastatic lesions, metastasis to one lung or both lungs, and

specific chemotherapy regimens. Third, today is the era of precision

medicine; simple clinical and pathological characteristics in this

study may not satisfy the evaluation of prognosis for tumors.

Integrating multiple biomarkers with clinical characteristics may

provide a more substantial prognostic value (36). However, in the

present study, we were unable to conduct this analysis due to the

lack of relevant data in SEER. Fourth, the study was a retrospective

rather than a prospective cohort study; recall bias was inherent in

retrospective studies. Fifth, the patients in the present study got

diagnosed between 2010 and 2015. With recent medical advances,

many new therapies have been applied to cancer patients. The

application of immunotherapy and new chemotherapeutic drugs

has changed the prognosis of patients to a certain degree. Hence, the

clinical guidance that can be given by this study was limited. In the

future, more new studies are needed to get more excellent

prediction models.
Conclusion

Based on the clinical variables in the SEER database, we

constructed and validated the prediction models for 1-, 3-, and 5-

year OS and CSS of patients with CCLM. The prognosis prediction

models could provide effective clinical prognostic evaluation for

patients with CCLM and guide clinicians to optimize

individualized treatment.
