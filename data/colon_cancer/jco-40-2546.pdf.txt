abstract

PURPOSE Prospective data on the efficacy of a watch-and-wait strategy to achieve organ preservation in patients
with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with total neoadjuvant therapy are limited.

METHODS In this prospective, randomized phase II trial, we assessed the outcomes of 324 patients with stage II
or III rectal adenocarcinoma treated with induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (INCT-CRT)
or chemoradiotherapy followed by consolidation chemotherapy (CRT-CNCT) and either total mesorectal ex-
cision (TME) or watch-and-wait on the basis of tumor response. Patients in both groups received 4 months of
infusional fluorouracil-leucovorin-oxaliplatin or capecitabine-oxaliplatin and 5,000 to 5,600 cGy of radiation
combined with either continuous infusion fluorouracil or capecitabine during radiotherapy. The trial was
designed as two stand-alone studies with disease-free survival (DFS) as the primary end point for both groups,
with a comparison to a null hypothesis on the basis of historical data. The secondary end point was TME-free
survival.

RESULTS Median follow-up was 3 years. Three-year DFS was 76% (95% CI, 69 to 84) for the INCT-CRT group
and 76% (95% CI, 69 to 83) for the CRT-CNCT group, in line with the 3-year DFS rate (75%) observed
historically. Three-year TME-free survival was 41% (95%CI, 33 to 50) in the INCT-CRT group and 53% (95%CI,
45 to 62) in the CRT-CNCT group. No differences were found between groups in local recurrence-free survival,
distant metastasis-free survival, or overall survival. Patients who underwent TME after restaging and patients who
underwent TME after regrowth had similar DFS rates.

CONCLUSION Organ preservation is achievable in half of the patients with rectal cancer treated with total
neoadjuvant therapy, without an apparent detriment in survival, compared with historical controls treated with
chemoradiotherapy, TME, and postoperative chemotherapy.

INTRODUCTION

Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT), total meso-
rectal excision (TME), and adjuvant chemotherapy is a
standard treatment for patients with locally advanced
rectal adenocarcinoma.1 This multimodality treatment,
although effective in achieving tumor control, is as-
sociated with significant morbidity, with bowel, urinary,
and sexual dysfunction that can impair patients’
quality of life permanently.2 In addition, many patients
with distal rectal cancer are left with a permanent
colostomy.2 As most of the sequelae from the multi-
modality therapy are related to surgery,3 there is a
strong incentive to explore nonsurgical treatment
options.

The excellent survival of patients with a pathologic
complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant therapy4

challenges the added benefit of TME for these pa-
tients.5 Retrospective case series and prospective
observational studies suggest that organ preservation
is feasible for selected patients treated with variable
neoadjuvant CRT regimens6,7; however, prospective
information on organ preservation for patients with
locally advanced rectal cancer treated with total
neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) is limited.7

Delivering chemotherapy before surgery, either before
or after CRT, is a newer treatment approach referred to
as TNT, which aims to improve compliance with
systemic chemotherapy and treat micrometastasis

earlier.8-11 Although preliminary data suggest that the se-
quence of chemotherapy and CRT affects the rate of tumor
response,12 the impact on organ preservation is unknown.

We conducted a prospective, randomized, multicenter
clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02008656) to
test the hypothesis that patients with stage II and III rectal
adenocarcinoma treated with TNT followed by either TME
or a selective watch-and-wait (WW) approach on the basis
of tumor response will have better disease-free survival
(DFS) compared with historical DFS in patients treated with
a standard therapy of CRT, TME, and intended postoper-
ative adjuvant chemotherapy. We also evaluated whether
the organ preservation rates would differ between patients
who underwent induction chemotherapy (INCT) followed
by CRT (INCT-CRT) and patients who underwent CRT
followed by consolidation chemotherapy (CRT-CNCT).

METHODS

Study Design

The Organ Preservation for Rectal Adenocarcinoma
(OPRA) Trial was a randomized, nonblinded, phase II trial
conducted at 18 US institutions. The trial protocol (Pro-
tocol, online only) was approved by the institutional review
boards of all participating institutions. All participants
provided written informed consent.

Eligible patients were older than 18 years of age and had
clinical stage II (T3-4, N0) or stage III (any T, N1-2) biopsy-
proven rectal adenocarcinoma staged with magnetic res-
onance imaging (MRI) according to a specified rectal
cancer protocol, a full colonoscopy, and computed to-
mography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Patients
with recurrent rectal cancer, evidence of distant metastasis
at diagnosis, or history of pelvic irradiation were excluded
(Protocol).

Random Assignment

Patients were recruited after required assessment and
tumor staging and before starting treatment. They were
randomly assigned to INCT-CRT or CRT-CNCT (Appendix
Fig A1, online only) using the clinical research database
CRDBi-Multicenter. Random assignment was stratified per
institution and accomplished by the method of random
permuted block.

Procedures

Radiotherapy was planned using a multiple-field technique
with either intensity-modulated radiotherapy or three-
dimensional conformal radiotherapy to deliver 4,500 cGy
in 180 cGy over 25 fractions to regional pelvic nodes (in-
cluding inguinal nodes for primary tumors involving the
anus). A total dose of 5,000-5,600 cGy was delivered to the
primary tumor and involved nodes with either a simulta-
neous integrated boost and/or a sequential boost. Patients
received either capecitabine (825 mg/m2 twice a day orally)
or continuous infusion fluorouracil (FU; 225mg/m2/d) during
radiotherapy permedical oncologist preference. Patients also
received eight cycles of infusional fluorouracil, leucovorin,
and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX; oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 intravenous
[IV], leucovorin 400 mg/m2 IV, FU 400 mg/m2 IV push, and
FU 2,400 mg/m2 over 46-48 hours by continuous infusion,
repeated on a 14-day cycle) or five cycles of capecitabine
and oxaliplatin (CAPEOX; oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 on day 1
and capecitabine at 1,000 g/m2 twice a day on days 1-14,
repeated on a 21-day cycle) before or after CRT.

Tumor restaging was performed by digital rectal examina-
tion, endoscopic examination, MRI, and CT of the chest,
abdomen, and pelvis, within 8 (64) weeks after TNT. Re-
sponse was graded as complete, near-complete, or in-
complete according to previously defined criteria. Patients
with incomplete clinical response were recommended TME.

CONTEXT

Key Objective
Can a potentially rectum-preserving treatment approach for locally advanced rectal cancer achieve outcomes similar to

those of standard resection-based treatment?
Knowledge Generated
Oncologic outcomes of patients treated with total neoadjuvant therapy and selective watch-and-wait or total mesorectal

excision (on the basis of tumor response) are comparable to the outcomes of patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy
and total mesorectal excision. The order of chemoradiation and systemic chemotherapy does not affect disease-free
survival, but chemoradiation followed by consolidation chemotherapy appears to be associated with a higher rate of organ
preservation.

Relevance
The potentially rectum-preserving treatment approach for locally advanced rectal cancer appears to be safe in patients with

a complete or near-complete response to total neoadjuvant therapy who are willing to undergo a strict surveillance
protocol. This treatment approach can help patients maintain a higher quality of life compared with standard resection-
based treatment.

OPRA Trial

https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02008656


Patients with clinical complete response (cCR) or near-
complete response were offered participation in a stan-
dardizedWW protocol consisting of digital rectal examination
and flexible sigmoidoscopy every 4 months for the first
2 years from the time of assessment of response, and every
6 months for the following 3 years. Rectal MRI was to be
performed every 6 months for the first 2 years and yearly for
the following 3 years.13 However, patients were evaluated at
more frequent intervals if considered necessary by the in-
vestigators. Patients with sustained clinical response com-
pared with the previous evaluation were recommended to
continue the WW follow-up protocol. Patients with signs of
lack of ongoing response compared with their previous
evaluation or with signs of tumor regrowth on endoscopy or
MRI were recommended to undergo TME. Biopsies of the
primary tumor sites for patients on WW were not required by
protocol. All patients were to have CT scans of the chest,
abdomen, and pelvis at least once a year. Patients who had
TME were surveyed according to current guidelines.1 All
patients had surveillance colonoscopy according to current
guidelines.14

Outcomes

The primary end point was DFS, defined as the interval from
random assignment to the first occurrence of locoregional
failure, distant metastasis, a new invasive colorectal pri-
mary cancer, or death from any cause. Locoregional failure
was defined as either an unresectable rectal primary tumor
following protocol neoadjuvant treatment, an R2 resection
for the rectal primary tumor, or recurrence in the primary
tumor bed after an R0-R1 resection. Tumor regrowth in the
rectal wall or in regional lymph nodes after a cCR or near-
complete response and a period of WW was not considered
a locoregional failure if it was followed by an R0-R1 re-
section. Organ preservation, defined as TME-free survival
measured in the intention-to-treat population, was the
secondary end point. Other secondary outcomes included
adverse events, local recurrence, distant recurrence, and
overall survival. Additional end points included bowel,
urinary, and sexual function and quality of life. Adverse
events during TNT were measured using the Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0.

Statistical Analysis

The trial was designed as two stand-alone phase II studies
with similar hypotheses. Power and sample size calculations
were based on an estimated 75% 3-year DFS for similar
patients treated according to a standard approach of che-
moradiation and TME.4 We hypothesized that 85% of pa-
tients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with TNT
and selective organ preservation would be alive and disease-
free at 3 years. Each group was designed to discriminate
between 3-year DFS rates of 75% and 85%. Assuming
accrual rates of 2-4 per group and month, and a two-sided
type I error of 5%, we required 101 patients evaluable for the
primary end point per group to have 85% power.15

For the secondary end point, we used pCR rates from
previous data, 20% for the INCT-CRT group and 35% for
the CRT-CNCT group (Protocol). If both arms met the end
point in primary objective, we planned to use the organ
preservation rate to determine the regimen for further
study, using a pick-the-winner strategy. We estimated that
the 202 patients (plus 10% to account for dropout) re-
quired for the primary aim would be sufficient to detect
differences in organ preservation rates. Following the ac-
crual of the first 101 evaluable patients in each group, and

after finding a higher rate of complete response than an-
ticipated in both arms, the study consortium elected to
allow accrual and random assignment to continue to
provide additional data for better estimates of survival and
organ preservation rates (Protocol, Amendment 18A). All
analyses done on the final cohort were also performed on
the initial cohort: 101 evaluable patients in the INCT-CRT
group and 106 evaluable patients in the CRT-CNCT group.

DFS, organ preservation, local recurrence-free survival,
distant metastasis-free survival, and overall survival were
analyzed using Cox regression and summarized using
Kaplan-Meier curves. Tumor regrowth from restaging for
patients with cCR who were offered WW was summarized
using similar time-to-event. Treatment compliance and ad-
verse events were summarized by group. Additional analyses
directly comparing clinical outcomes using the log-rank test
were conducted. Multivariate Cox regression models were fit
to the full cohort. All analyses were conducted in R.

RESULTS

From April 12, 2014, to March 30, 2020, 360 patients were
registered to the trial at 18 centers (Appendix Table A1,
online only). Of the 324 eligible patients, 158 were

randomly assigned to the INCT-CRT group and 166 to the
CRT-CNCT group (Fig 1). Most patients were males and
had stage III tumors, located at, 5 cm from the anal verge
on average. The baseline and clinical characteristics were
well balanced between the groups (Table 1, Appendix Table
A2, online only). Twelve patients withdrew consent after
random assignment, before or after starting neoadjuvant
therapy. Most patients in both groups started the assigned
treatment (Table 2, Appendix Table A3, online only). The
proportion of patients receiving the number of prescribed
cycles of systemic chemotherapy was similar in both
groups. Overall, more patients received FOLFOX compared
with CAPEOX, but the proportion of patients receiving either
was similar in both groups. The median dose of radiation
was also similar in both groups. The time intervals from the
start of treatment to restaging and from the end of treatment
to restaging were similar in both groups. The time interval
from the end of CRT to tumor restaging was longer in the
CRT-CNCT group compared with the INCT-CRT group by
study design (Table 2, Appendix Fig A1).

Six patients (2%), three in each group, died during TNT
(Fig 1, Table 2), five from treatment-related toxicity and one
from causes unrelated to treatment. Two patients in the
INCT-CRT group never had restaging, one because of tumor
perforation requiring emergency surgery and one because

of disease progression. There was no difference in the rate of
adverse events between treatment groups (Table 2).

The data for all outcomes were available up to February 10,
2021. Median follow-up for patients who were alive and
event-free at the time of analysis was 3 years (interquartile
range [IQR], 1.84-4.06). The event for the primary end
point, DFS, occurred in 75 patients, 36 in the INCT-CRT
group and 39 in the CRT-CNCT group. The 3-year DFS
rates, 76% (95% CI, 69 to 84) for the INCT-CRT group and
76% (95% CI, 69 to 83) in the CRT-CNCT group, did not
differ when compared with the historical 3-year DFS rate of
75% (Fig 2, Appendix Fig A2A, online only). Therefore, the
primary end point of the study, an improvement in DFS
among patients treated with TNT and selective WW com-
pared with historical controls, was not met. Among the 75
observed events for DFS, 41 were distant metastasis, 11
were local recurrence, 10 were persistent disease events,
and 10 were death from any cause. The rates of local
recurrence-free survival (94% [95% CI, 89 to 99] for INCT
and 94% [95% CI, 90 to 98] for CNCT) and distant
metastasis-free survival (84% [95% CI, 77 to 91] for INCT
and 82% [95% CI, 75 to 89] for CNCT) were similar in both
groups (Fig 2). Overall survival is provided, but these data
will require additional follow-up. Clinical nodal metastasis
(cN1) on baseline MRI was the only variable associated

with DFS in univariable and multivariable analyses (hazard
ratio [HR] 2.26; 95% CI, 1.23 to 4.17).

Of 304 patients restaged at the end of TNT, 79 (26%) were
recommended to undergo TME; 41 of 146 (28%) in the
INCT-CRT group and 38 of 158 (24%) in the CRT-CNCT
group. The remaining 225 (74%) patients, 105/146 (71%)
in the INCT-CRT and 120/158 (76%) in the CRT-CNCT,
were offered WW (Fig 1). Of the 225 patients initially en-
tered in the WW protocol, 42/105 (40%) in the INCT-CRT
group and 33/120 (27%) in the CRT-CNCT group

developed tumor regrowth during follow-up (Figs 1 and 3A).
All patients diagnosed with tumor regrowth were recom-
mended for TME. For the intention-to-treat organ preser-
vation analysis, patients who had local excision, patients
who refused TME, and patients with TME withheld because
of distant progression were all censored as having TME.
Patients who refused TME were also censored as having
persistent disease for the DFS analysis. The proportion of
patients who preserved the rectum at 3 years for the
intention-to-treat population was 53% (95% CI, 45 to 62)

had TME (71 at restaging for incomplete response and 62
during WW for tumor regrowth; Fig 1). The DFS rates were
similar for patients having TME after restaging and for pa-
tients having TME after regrowth, both for the intention-to-
treat population and for the patients who underwent TME
(Fig 4). The median time from the day of restaging to the day
of TME was 7 (IQR, 3-9.5) weeks in patients recommended
TME at restaging and 30 (IQR, 20-103) weeks in patients
recommended TMEafter regrowth. Six patients in each group
have not reached the first follow-up clinical assessment after
TME. The numbers of patients having TME at restaging or
after tumor regrowth who developed local recurrence and
distant metastasis after surgery, both for the intention-to-treat
and true TME analyses, are presented in Appendix Table A4
(online only). The rate of sphincter-saving surgery was higher
in patients having TME at restaging (39/71, 55%) compared
with patients having TME after regrowth (27/62, 44%), but
the difference was not statistically significant (P5 .2). There
was no statistically significant difference in the rate of
sphincter-saving surgery between treatment groups. The
pathologic outcomes for patients having surgery, both local
excision and TME, are presented in Table 3.

DISCUSSION

For patients with locally advanced rectal cancer, a treat-
ment approach including selective WW for patients with a
cCR to TNT provides similar DFS compared with historical

control patients treated with neoadjuvant CRT, TME, and
intended adjuvant chemotherapy. Although the primary
end point of 3-year DFS rates in both arms did not reach the
upper critical value specified by the study design, they were
in line with historical controls and are within the range
reported in recent prospective clinical trials.10,11,16-19 We
also found that many patients treated with TNT, approxi-
mately half of those receiving CRT-CNCT, achieved a
sustained cCR and preserved the rectum at 3 years.

The failure to reject the null hypothesis has several potential
explanations. First are potential differences in patient
characteristics such as tumor stage and distance from the
anal verge between the study population and historical
controls. Second, it is possible that TNT may not improve
DFS compared with standard CRT, TME, and postoperative
chemotherapy. The GCR-3 trial, a small phase II study,
failed to demonstrate a difference in pCR or survival in
patients with stage II and III rectal adenocarcinoma ran-
domly assigned to chemotherapy before or after CRT and
TME.20 By contrast, two recent large studies using different
TNT regimens reported lower disease-related treatment
failure or DFS in the experimental arms compared with the
standard arm of chemoradiation, TME surgery, and post-
operative chemotherapy.10,11 However, neither study
showed improved overall survival in the experimental
compared with the standard arm.10,11 Alternatively, it is
possible that the WW strategy had a detrimental effect on

OPRA Trial



patient DFS. A definitive proof of the safety and efficacy of
organ preservation in rectal adenocarcinoma would require
a large phase III trial with a noninferiority design, where
patients achieving a cCR to TNT would be randomly
assigned to TME or a WW strategy, although such a trial
would be extremely unlikely to accrue.

We found that close to half of the patients treated with TNT
achieved a sustained cCR and preserved the rectum. Al-
though the median follow-up is still relatively short, and
more patients may develop regrowth and require surgery in
the future, the time to TME curve in this study and pre-
viously reported retrospective series suggests that the
overwhelming majority of cases of regrowth occur during
the first 2 years after completion of neoadjuvant therapy.6

The organ preservation rate in the OPRA trial was sub-
stantially higher than the pCR rates reported in recent
clinical trials for patients with locally advanced rectal ade-
nocarcinoma treated with TNT and TME.8-12 The explana-
tion for this is not clear. These variations in tumor response
could be attributed to differences in patient inclusion criteria
or treatment plans, but they can also be attributed to the
long interval from the end of TNT to the assessment of tumor
response and to offering WW to patients with near-complete
clinical response. In addition, almost 10% of patients un-
dergoing TME had a pCR (no residual cancer cells in the
surgical specimens), further highlighting rectal cancer re-
sponsiveness to TNT, as well as the difficulty in identifying
patients with a complete response.

The higher organ preservation rate in patients treated with
CRT-CNCT compared with INCT-CRT is consistent with the
results of the CAO/ARO/AIO-12 trial, which reported a higher
rate of pathologic complete response in patients with rectal
cancer treated with CRT followed by three cycles of FOLFOX
and TME compared with patients treated with three cycles of
FOLFOX followed by CRT and TME.12 Similar to the CAO/
ARO/AIO-12 trial, the difference in organ preservation in the
OPRA trial cannot be attributed to differences in total dose of
radiation or chemotherapy received, in total treatment time,
or in time intervals from the initiation and from the end of
neoadjuvant therapy to assessment of tumor response. The
different time interval from the end of chemoradiation to the
assessment of response has been considered a potential
factor contributing to the difference in organ preservation
between groups. However, the results of the trial are not
totally consistent with this interpretation, as the proportion of
patients recommended for WW at restaging plus the pro-
portion of patients with pCR among those who had surgery
immediately after restaging did not differ (78% CRT-CNCT v
75% INCT-CRT). By contrast, the higher rate of tumor
regrowth in the INCT-CRT group (40%) compared with the
CRT-CNCT group (27%) suggests that the difference in
organ preservationmay be due, at least in part, to differences
in tumor regrowth and not in the proportion of patients
initially recommended for WW.

A major perceived drawback of the WW strategy is the
potential risk of tumor spread among patients with an

apparent complete or near-complete clinical response who
are initially observed and later develop tumor regrowth. We
found no significant difference in outcomes among patients
recommended for TME immediately after restaging com-
pared with WW patients recommended for TME after tumor
regrowth. The results were similar in the intention-to-treat
population and in the patients who actually had TME. Our
results are consistent with a report from Dr Habr-Gama’s
group who described no survival detriment in patients who
had delayed surgery for suspected cCR.21

In conclusion, a treatment strategy including TNT and
selective WW or TME on the basis of tumor response
allows organ preservation in almost half of the patients
with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma without an
apparent adverse impact on oncologic outcomes. Al-
though the sequence of the CRT and systemic chemo-
therapy did not affect DFS, delivering CRT before systemic
chemotherapy appeared to result in a higher rate of organ
preservation compared with delivering CRT after systemic
chemotherapy.
