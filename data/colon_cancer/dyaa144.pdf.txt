Abstract

Background: Previous case-control studies have reported a strong association between

statin use and lower cancer risk. It is unclear whether this association reflects a benefit of

statins or is the result of design decisions that cannot be mapped to a (hypothetical) tar-

get trial (that would answer the question of interest).

Methods: We outlined the protocol of a target trial to estimate the effect of statins on

colorectal cancer incidence among adults with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol

below 5 mmol/L. We then emulated the target trial using linked electronic health records

of 752 469 eligible UK adults (CALIBER 1999–2016) under both a cohort design and a

case-control sampling of the cohort. We used pooled logistic regression to estimate

intention-to-treat and per-protocol effects of statins on colorectal cancer, with adjustment

for baseline and time-varying risk factors via inverse-probability weighting. Finally, we

compared our case-control effect estimates with those obtained using previous case-

control procedures.

Results: Over the 6-year follow-up, 3596 individuals developed colorectal cancer.

Estimated intention-to-treat and per-protocol hazard ratios were 1.00 (95% confidence in-

terval [CI]: 0.87, 1.16) and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.12), respectively. As expected, adequate

case-control sampling yielded the same estimates. By contrast, previous case-control an-

alytical approaches yielded estimates that appeared strongly protective (odds ratio 0.57,

95% CI: 0.36, 0.91, for �5 vs. <5 years of statin use).

Conclusions: Our study demonstrates how to explicitly emulate a target trial using case-

control data to reduce discrepancies between observational and randomized trial

evidence. This approach may inform future case-control analyses for comparative effec-

tiveness research.

Introduction

Many important clinical decisions must be made in the ab-

sence of evidence from randomized trials, which may be

impractical or too lengthy to provide a timely answer. In

these cases, we resort to analyses of observational data to

emulate the target trial that we would have liked to con-

duct and provide the best available evidence to inform de-

cision making.1,2

The target trial approach has mostly been applied to

cohort (follow-up) studies, but it can be readily extended

to case-control studies when (i) the goal is to estimate

relative (not absolute) risks or rates, and (ii) information

on treatments or confounders is not available for the en-

tire cohort but can be obtained for a smaller subset of

cases and controls.3 It is well known that an analysis of

the entire cohort and an analysis of the case-control data

(which is just an efficient sampling from the underlying

cohort) are expected to yield identical results.4

However, for these estimates to be equivalent (and

meaningful), both the cohort analysis and the case-

control analysis must estimate the same quantities as the

target trial. For example, if adjustment for time-varying

confounding or selection bias due to loss to follow-up is

required to emulate the target trial in the cohort, then

such adjustment is also required to emulate the target

trial using the case-control data.

Therefore, like any study that attempts to emulate a tar-

get trial, case-control designs generally require an explicit

definition of the start of follow-up (time zero) as well as

data on time-varying treatments and time-varying con-

founders from the start of follow-up. Deviations from the

target trial framework may lead to bias in case-control

studies as in cohort studies.

Consider the example of statins and cancer. Several case-

control studies have reported a strong association between

statin use and lower cancer risk.5–10 For example, a case-

control study reported a substantially lower risk of colorec-

tal cancer among long-term statin users compared with

shorter-term and non-users.6 The magnitude of this protec-

tive estimate is implausible, and it is not compatible with

the estimates from meta-analyses of randomized trials (odds

ratio for colon cancer 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]:

0.73, 1.25).11,12 This lower risk is also unlikely to be en-

tirely explained by confounding, because the indications for

statins (e.g. elevated low-density lipoprotein [LDL] choles-

terol) are not such strong drivers of colorectal cancer risk.

Here we estimate the effect of statins on colorectal can-

cer using observational data from electronic health

records. We use a case-control design rather than, as we

did previously,13 a cohort design, and we add linkage of

electronic health records from primary care, hospital and

death registries. To describe how a target trial can be emu-

lated using case-control data, we first specify the protocol

of the (hypothetical) target trial that would have answered

the causal question of interest, then define the observa-

tional cohort study that explicitly emulates this target trial,

and finally sample cases and controls from that cohort. We

show that a case-control design that deviates from the tar-

get trial may lead to implausible estimates similar to those

previously reported.

Key Messages

• Previous case-control studies have reported a strong association between statin use and lower cancer risk; it is unclear

whether this reflects a benefit of statins or is the result of design decisions that cannot be mapped to a (hypothetical) tar-

get trial (that would answer the question of interest).

• A target trial can be emulated using case-control data by (i) specifying the protocol of the target trial that would have an-

swered the causal question of interest, (ii) defining the observational cohort study that explicitly emulates this target

trial, and (iii) sampling cases and controls from that cohort.

• This approach reduces bias in the effect estimates derived from case-control studies and minimizes discrepancies be-

tween observational and randomized trial evidence.

• Case-control analyses that deviate from this approach may lead to severe bias, particularly on the multiplicative scale.

adults with LDL cholesterol below 5 mmol/L.13 Table 1

summarizes the key protocol components (see also

Supplementary Appendix 1, available as Supplementary

data at IJE online). Briefly, the eligibility criteria include

age �30, no history of cancer, no statin contraindication,

no statin prescription within the past year and LDL choles-

terol <5 mmol/L. The treatment strategies to be compared

are initiation of any statin therapy at baseline and continu-

ation over follow-up until the development of a contraindi-

cation (hepatic impairment or myopathy) and no initiation

of statin therapy over follow-up unless there is an indica-

tion (LDL cholesterol �5 mmol/L). Participants are fol-

lowed for up to 6 years or until colorectal cancer

diagnosis.

Target trial emulation

We explicitly emulated this target trial under both a cohort

design and a case-control sampling of the cohort, using ob-

servational data from the Clinical Practice Research

Datalink, Hospital Episode Statistics and Office of

National Statistics: population-based datasets comprised

of longitudinal UK electronic health records from primary

care, hospital and death registries, accessed through the

CALIBER resource (see also Supplementary Appendix

1).15,16

Cohort analysis

We mirrored each protocol component as closely as possi-

ble, with several modifications to accommodate our use of

observational data (Table 1). For example, to assess base-

line confounders, we required information on laboratory

values measured during the past year and lifestyle factors

during the past 4 years. We classified individuals into two

groups according to their prescription records at baseline.

We assumed these groups were exchangeable at baseline

conditional on the covariates in Table 2. The analysis pro-

ceeded as for the target trial, with adjustment for these

baseline covariates in an attempt to emulate randomization

(see also Supplementary Appendix 2, available as

Supplementary data at IJE online).

Case-control analysis

We sampled cases and controls from the assembled cohort

of eligible individuals via incidence density sampling.17

Cases were all individuals diagnosed with colorectal cancer

over the study period. Controls were individuals who were

alive, under follow-up and free of colorectal cancer at the

time of selection. To reduce differences due to random var-

iability when comparing the cohort and case-control

estimates, we randomly selected 1000 controls per case

(case-control studies are typically based on a much lower

number of controls). The analysis of the case-control data

proceeded as for the cohort analysis (see also

Supplementary Appendix 3, available as Supplementary

data at IJE online). The odds ratio from the case-control

data is an unbiased estimator of the rate ratio obtained

from the full cohort.4 Therefore, if the cohort analysis cor-

rectly estimates the hazard ratios from the target trial in

Table 1, then the case-control analysis does too.

Deviations from the target trial

In separate analyses, we applied the analytical approach of

a previous case-control study to our data to demonstrate

how deviations from the target trial framework lead to

bias. The previous study reported an odds ratio of 0.53

(95% CI: 0.38, 0.74) when comparing colorectal cancer

cases and controls in terms of their statin use: �5 vs.

<5 years.6 To assess statin use and potential confounders,

eligible cases and controls were interviewed in person by

the research team. This study deviated from its correspond-

ing target trial in several ways.

First, the analysis was restricted to eligible cases and

controls who could be interviewed, that is, individuals had

to remain alive and under follow-up for a period after be-

ing selected for the study. The length of the period between

selection and interview is unknown, but the authors

reported that 19.4% of eligible cases could not be located

or approached because they had died or been lost to fol-

low-up.6 In our study, a similar 18.7% loss of eligible cases

would require a 3-month period between selection and in-

terview. This 3-month survival requirement does not exist

in the target trial.

Second, cases and controls were classified based on their

observed cumulative duration of statin therapy through the

time of diagnosis (selection) for cases but through the time

of interview (post-selection) for controls. Compared with

the target trial, this approach corresponds to neither the

intention-to-treat analysis (which assigns individuals to a

treatment strategy based on baseline information only) nor

the per-protocol analysis (which assigns individuals to a

treatment strategy based on baseline information and then

censors them at deviation from the baseline assignment).

Further, this case-control study used a longer period of po-

tential statin use for controls (baseline to interview) than

for cases (baseline to diagnosis).

Third, the analysis adjusted for covariates assessed at

the time of interview. From a target trial perspective, this is

equivalent to adjusting for variables measured at or after

the end of follow-up. By contrast, a correct intention-to-

treat analysis adjusts for baseline confounders and a cor-

rect per-protocol analysis adjusts for baseline and post-

baseline (time-varying) confounders during the follow-up.

Because this case-control study ignored time-varying con-

founders, the analysis did not need inverse-probability

weighting.

Fourth, the study included cases and controls who

were using statins before baseline (prevalent users) and

used pre-baseline statin therapy to quantify total

duration of use. These individuals would not be eligible

for the target trial.

To assess the cumulative impact of these deviations

from the target trial on the estimates, we sequentially

implemented them in our own case-control analysis. First,

we restricted our case-control analysis to individuals alive

and under follow-up 3 months after selection. We also

implemented an equivalent cohort analysis that excludes

all monthly records within 3 months of death or censoring.

As a sensitivity analysis, we examined a 6-month (rather

than 3-month) survival requirement.

Second, we classified cases and controls by their cumu-

lative duration of statin use (�5 vs. <5 years) after baseline

through selection for cases and through selection þ 3

months for controls. Again, we implemented an equivalent

cohort analysis that (i) excludes all monthly records within

3 months of death or censoring and (ii) assesses cumulative

statin use through the current month for event person-

months and through the current month þ 3 months for

non-event person-months.

Third, we adjusted for covariates measured at the time

of selection, instead of at baseline or later, by including

them in the pooled logistic model. We were unable to use

pre-baseline statin therapy to quantify total duration of use

because we lacked complete pre-baseline histories for some

individuals in the cohort.

Statins and all-cause mortality

To show the generality of our approach, we repeated these

analyses for statin therapy and all-cause mortality. We se-

lected all-cause mortality as an alternative outcome be-

cause the magnitude of the intention-to-treat effect of

statins on all-cause mortality is known from randomized

trials (risk ratio 0.86, 95% CI: 0.80, 0.93) and can be used

as a benchmark.18 We emulated a target trial using the

same data, with additional eligibility criteria of no cardio-

vascular disease at baseline and an increased cardiovascu-

lar risk (defined as LDL cholesterol �3.4 mmol/L) and

with up to 10 years of follow-up. Here, replicating a 3-

month survival requirement after selection only resulted in

a loss of controls, not cases.

All analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 (SAS

Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

Table 3 shows estimated 6-year risk differences and

hazard ratios when emulating a target trial of statin ther-

apy and colorectal cancer. In the full cohort, the estimated

6-year risk differences were 0% (95% CI: -0.1%, 0.2%) in

the intention-to-treat analysis and -0.1% (95% CI: -0.2%,

0.1%) in the per-protocol analysis, and the estimated haz-

ard ratios were 1.00 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.16) in the intention-

to-treat analysis and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.12) in the per-

protocol analysis. The odds ratios from the case-control

sample were identical to the hazard ratios from the cohort.

Estimated hazard ratios were identical when additionally

adjusting for cancer screening in the past year (data not ta-

bled). Estimated hazard ratios were similar when only

adjusting for age (intention-to-treat hazard ratio 1.03,

95% CI: 0.89, 1.19; per-protocol hazard ratio 0.97, 95%

CI: 0.80, 1.20) (data not tabled).

We then replicated the approach of the previous case-

control study in our data (Table 3). The estimated odds ra-

tio for colorectal cancer was 0.55 (95% CI: 0.35, 0.87)

when we imposed the 3-month survival requirement and

assessed cumulative statin use through the time of selection

(diagnosis) for cases and through the time of selection þ 3

months for controls. When imposing this survival require-

ment and instead assessing statin use through the time of

selection for both cases and controls, the odds ratio esti-

mate was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.53, 1.34) (data not tabled).

Estimates were similar when adjusting for covariates

measured at the time of selection instead of at baseline.

Cohort analyses mimicking these decisions returned the

same estimates. A 6-month survival requirement yielded

stronger inverse associations (Supplementary Table S2,

available as Supplementary data at IJE online).

Imposing the 3-month survival requirement resulted in

a loss of 672 eligible cases (18.7%), including 418 who

died (11.6%) (similar to the proportions reported in the

published study: 19.4% and 8.6%, respectively), and a loss

of 298 380 eligible controls (8.3%), including 13 047 who

died (0.4%) (Figure 2). Among individuals who remained

alive and under follow-up 3 months after selection, a

slightly lower proportion of cases was classified as having

�5 years of statin use compared with the distribution of

exposure at the time of selection (0.6% vs. 1.0%). In addi-

tion, 6847 surviving controls were re-classified as having

�5 years of statin use when statin use was assessed through

selection þ 3 months. These small shifts in absolute pro-

portions (slight depletion of cases and enrichment of con-

trols for �5 years of statin use) are responsible for the large

shifts on the odds ratio (multiplicative) scale.

Statins and all-cause mortality

When emulating a target trial of statins and all-cause mor-

tality, we estimated an intention-to-treat hazard ratio of

0.87 (95% CI: 0.79, 0.95) which is close to the estimate

from a meta-analysis of randomized trials (risk ratio 0.86,

95% CI: 0.80, 0.93) (Supplementary Table S3, available as

Supplementary data at IJE online).18 This estimate pro-

gressively decreased when we applied the analytical flaws

described above (Supplementary Table S3).

Discussion

After emulating a target trial using the electronic health

records of 752 469 adults with up to 6 years of follow-up,

we found little evidence that the risk of colorectal cancer

differs between statin users and nonusers. This finding is

consistent with meta-analyses of randomized trials.11,12 As

expected, adequate case-control sampling returned the

same estimates as the cohort analysis. By contrast, after

replicating the analytical approach of a previous case-

control study in our data, we found implausibly protective

estimates similar to those previously reported.

Case-control studies may have a role to play when con-

ducting causal inference research based on health care

databases. While such databases provide access to the

underlying cohort that gives rise to cases and controls, they

may not contain high-quality information on treatment or

confounders needed to answer certain causal questions.3 In

these settings, case-control studies allow us to focus limited

resources on collecting this information for random sam-

ples of cases and controls.

Case-control analyses may seem simple: we compare

the treatment status of cases with non-cases. However, a

failure to anchor this to an underlying cohort study that

explicitly emulates a target trial contributes to two com-

mon misconceptions about case-control analyses: (i) that

they are immune to many of the biases that afflict cohort

analyses, such as time-varying confounding and selection

bias due to loss to follow-up and the inclusion of prevalent

users, and (ii) that they do not require complete treatment

and confounder history for cases and controls. While crit-

ics of case-control designs within existing databases have

largely focused on design flaws leading to confounding

bias,19 our evaluation showed that other deviations from a

target trial in case-control analyses lead to the same biases

that affect cohort analyses.

Two deviations from the target trial appeared to drive

the biased estimates in this particular application: (i) the

requirement for cases and controls to survive for 3

additional months and (ii) the assessment of treatment

duration over a longer time period for controls

compared with cases. Together, these decisions led to small

shifts in treatment classification that depleted cases and

enriched controls for �5 years of statin use. Importantly,

we found that effect estimates on the multiplicative scale,

which are generally all that we can obtain from case-

control studies, may be particularly susceptible to these

biases.

Other deviations from the target trial may, in general,

matter. First, comparing cumulative duration of treatment

above vs. below a certain threshold (e.g. �5 vs. <5 years)

does not capture information on the precise timing, dura-

tion, or reasons for switching treatment, which may be im-

portant for risk. In our analysis, the estimated odds ratio

comparing �5 vs. <5 years of statin use (0.95, 95% CI:

0.67, 1.34; with no survival requirement, data not tabled)

was similar to the intention-to-treat hazard ratio (1.00,

95% CI: 0.86, 1.16), possibly because treatment had no ef-

fect on the outcome in this particular application. Second,

adjustment for variables measured at (or after) the time of

selection will not appropriately adjust for confounding and

may induce selection bias. In our analysis, this had little

impact possibly because, as suggested by the similarity be-

tween age- and fully-adjusted estimates, the adjustment

variables were not strong predictors of the outcome no

matter when they were measured. Third, failure to adjust

gIn the case-control sample: (i) the analysis was restricted to individuals alive and under follow-up 3 months after selection, and (ii) cumulative statin use after

baseline was assessed through the time of selection (diagnosis) for cases and through the time of selection þ 3 months for controls. In the full cohort: (i) the analy-

sis excluded monthly records within 3 months of death or censoring, and (ii) cumulative statin use was assessed through the current month for event person-

months and through the current month þ 3 months for non-event person months.

for loss to follow-up may result in selection bias if remaining

uncensored depends on treatment history and risk factors. In

our analysis, estimates were similar when additionally apply-

ing inverse-probability weights for censoring due to loss to

follow-up. Last, including prevalent users at baseline may

contribute to selection bias due to the selection of individuals

who received pre-baseline treatment for some time and

remained at risk and under follow-up at baseline. We were

unable to explore this deviation in our data. Our approach

of explicitly specifying the protocol of the target trial and its

observational emulation naturally leads to analytical

approaches that prevent these biases.

Our study has several additional strengths. The volume

and variety of data in the electronic health records allowed

us to evaluate statins and colorectal cancer in a

population-based sample with adjustment for many poten-

tial confounders. Our analytical approach allowed us to es-

timate both relative and absolute risks under sustained

strategies that realistically depend on dynamic clinical fea-

tures. Last, our analyses of all-cause mortality support that

the target trial approach can reproduce effect estimates

from trials and that the analytical flaws described above

will result in bias for this alternative outcome.

Nevertheless, we were limited by our reliance on diag-

nosis codes and prescription records, which may contribute

to measurement error and residual confounding. However,

previous validation studies have confirmed a high propor-

tion of recorded cancers (95%) and other diagnoses in this

database.20,21

In summary, our findings suggest that flaws in case-

control analyses can be mapped to decisions in a cohort

analysis which would lead to bias, particularly on the mul-

tiplicative scale. Explicitly mapping case-control sampling

to the target trial helped us to reduce bias. Our approach

may help to inform the design and analysis of any case-

control study where the goal is to assess the benefit-risk of

medical treatments.
