Abstract

BACKGROUND—Pelvic radiation plus sensitizing chemotherapy with a fluoropyrimidine 

(chemoradiotherapy) before surgery is standard care for locally advanced rectal cancer in 

North America. Whether neoadjuvant chemotherapy with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin 

(FOLFOX) can be used in lieu of chemoradiotherapy is uncertain.

METHODS—We conducted a multicenter, unblinded, noninferiority, randomized trial of 

neoadjuvant FOLFOX (with chemoradiotherapy given only if the primary tumor decreased in 

size by <20% or if FOLFOX was discontinued because of side effects) as compared with 

chemoradiotherapy. Adults with rectal cancer that had been clinically staged as T2 node-positive, 

T3 node-negative, or T3 node-positive who were candidates for sphincter-sparing surgery were 

eligible to participate. The primary end point was disease-free survival. Noninferiority would be 

claimed if the upper limit of the two-sided 90.2% confidence interval of the hazard ratio for 

disease recurrence or death did not exceed 1.29. Secondary end points included overall survival, 

local recurrence (in a time-to-event analysis), complete pathological resection, complete response, 

and toxic effects.

RESULTS—From June 2012 through December 2018, a total of 1194 patients underwent 

randomization and 1128 started treatment; among those who started treatment, 585 were in 

the FOLFOX group and 543 in the chemoradiotherapy group. At a median follow-up of 58 

months, FOLFOX was noninferior to chemoradiotherapy for disease-free survival (hazard ratio 

for disease recurrence or death, 0.92; 90.2% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 1.14; P = 0.005 for 

noninferiority). Five-year disease-free survival was 80.8% (95% CI, 77.9 to 83.7) in the FOLFOX 

group and 78.6% (95% CI, 75.4 to 81.8) in the chemoradiotherapy group. The groups were similar 

with respect to overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.44) and local 

recurrence (hazard ratio, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.44 to 3.16). In the FOLFOX group, 53 patients (9.1%) 

received preoperative chemoradiotherapy and 8 (1.4%) received postoperative chemoradiotherapy.

CONCLUSIONS—In patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who were eligible 

for sphincter-sparing surgery, preoperative FOLFOX was noninferior to preoperative 

chemoradiotherapy with respect to disease-free survival. (Funded by the National Cancer Institute; 

PROSPECT ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01515787.)

Pelvic chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer reduces the risk of disease 

recurrence in the pelvis to less than 10% and has been standard care in North America 

since 1990.1–6 However, it is associated with short-term and long-term toxic effects7–9 that

can adversely affect quality of life and physical function.8 In 2004, a randomized trial 

established the superiority of preoperative to postoperative pelvic chemoradiotherapy with 

fluorouracil sensitization.10 Also in 2004, postoperative (adjuvant) chemotherapy with the 

FOLFOX regimen, which combines fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin, was found to 

prolong disease-free survival as compared with fluorouracil alone among patients with stage 

III colon cancer.11 FOLFOX has also been shown to be associated with high response rates 

when administered before chemoradiotherapy.2,12

These findings motivated us to investigate whether neoadjuvant treatment with FOLFOX 

could allow the elimination of chemoradiotherapy without increasing the risk of 

recurrence. In a single-center pilot trial of neoadjuvant FOLFOX in which administration 

of chemoradiotherapy was reserved for patients whose tumors did not respond to 

chemotherapy, we found favorable outcomes, with few patients going on to receive radiation 

and none having local disease recurrence.13 On the basis of these results, we designed 

the PROSPECT trial (Chemotherapy Alone or Chemotherapy Plus Radiation Therapy in 

Treating Patients with Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer Undergoing Surgery) to test the 

hypothesis that neoadjuvant FOLFOX, with chemoradiotherapy reserved for patients whose 

tumors responded poorly or in whom FOLFOX was discontinued because of side effects, 

would be noninferior to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy alone in patients with locally 

advanced rectal cancer that was amenable to sphincter-sparing surgery.

Methods

TRIAL DESIGN AND PATIENTS

We conducted a multicenter, unblinded, randomized, noninferiority trial with a seamless 

phase 2–3 design; the trial was sponsored by the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology 

(Alliance, a cooperative research network funded by the National Cancer Institute) and 

was conducted in Canada, Switzerland, and the United States at 264 academic and 

community-based institutions (see the protocol, available with the full text of this article 

at NEJM.org). We recruited patients 18 years of age or older who had previously untreated, 

pathologically confirmed, locally advanced rectal cancer that had been clinically staged as 

T2 node-positive, T3 node-negative, or T3 node-positive (Table S1 in the Supplementary 

Appendix, available at NEJM.org) on the basis of the tumor–node–metastasis system in 

the Cancer Staging Manual of the American Joint Committee on Cancer, 7th edition. 

For a patient to be eligible, the patient’s primary surgeon had to consider neoadjuvant 

pelvic chemoradiotherapy followed by a sphincter-sparing operation as the appropriate 

treatment approach. Participants had to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 

(ECOG) performance-status score of 0, 1, or 2 (scores range from 0 to 5, with higher scores 

indicating greater disability). Patients with T4 tumors, four or more pelvic lymph nodes with 

a short axis larger than 10 mm, or tumor visible within 3 mm of the radial margin seen on 

baseline pelvic imaging were ineligible. Among the other exclusion criteria were previous 

pelvic radiation therapy, chemotherapy within the previous 5 years, or abnormal laboratory 

measures.

TRIAL OVERSIGHT

The trial was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and 

the International Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The protocol 

was approved by the institutional review board at each participating institution or by the 

National Cancer Institute (NCI) central institutional review board. All the patients provided 

written informed consent before enrollment. The trial was monitored by the Alliance data 

and safety monitoring board twice per year. In April 2016, the data and safety monitoring 

board determined that the phase 2 data met the criteria for seamlessly proceeding to the 

phase 3 trial. Because fewer recurrences and deaths were noted than had been projected, 

the coprimary end points of disease-free survival and local recurrence (in a time-to-event 

analysis) were modified to disease-free survival alone. The statistical redesign was led by 

an independent statistician who was unaware of the trial data in collaboration with the NCI 

Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program and was approved by the data and safety monitoring 

board in May 2021. The amendments and statistical analysis plan are provided in the 

protocol. The first two authors developed the trial design, and the second author had access 

to the raw data after release and analyzed the data. The authors vouch for the accuracy and 

completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol. The NCI funded the 

trial and approved the design but had no role in the interpretation of the data.

RANDOMIZATION AND PROCEDURES

Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was recommended at baseline, but contrast-

enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis plus endorectal 

ultrasonography was an acceptable alternative. After eligibility was confirmed, patients 

underwent randomization in a 1:1 ratio on the basis of a dynamic randomization scheme 

with stratification according to ECOG performance-status score (a score of 0 or 1 vs. 2).

Patients in the FOLFOX group received six cycles of modified FOLFOX614 administered 

intravenously every 2 weeks, followed by restaging with pelvic imaging and rectal 

endoscopy. Patients who were unable to complete at least five cycles of FOLFOX were 

given chemoradiotherapy (with the use of the procedures used in the chemoradiotherapy 

group; see below). Patients whose primary tumor had decreased in size by at least 20% as 

determined by the surgeon on the basis of restaging imaging, proctoscopy, and physical 

examination proceeded to surgery, and those whose primary tumor had decreased in 

size by less than 20% received chemoradiotherapy. Postoperative chemoradiotherapy was 

recommended for patients in the FOLFOX group whose resection was not pathologically 

complete (R0). Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with an additional six cycles of 

FOLFOX was suggested but not mandated.

Patients in the chemoradiotherapy group received pelvic radiotherapy with 50.4 Gy 

delivered in 28 fractions, together with sensitizing fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy delivered 

either as a continuous intravenous infusion of fluorouracil at a dose of 225 mg per 

square meter of body-surface area per day or as oral capecitabine at a dose of 825 mg 

per square meter twice daily, 5 days per week on days of radiation therapy, with the 

choice at the discretion of the patient and medical oncologist. Postoperative adjuvant 

chemotherapy with eight cycles of FOLFOX was suggested but not mandated. In both

treatment groups, the choice between three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy or intensity-

modulated radiotherapy was at the discretion of the radiation oncologist. The surgical 

approach (open resection vs. laparoscopic or robot-assisted) was chosen at the surgeon’s 

discretion.

END POINTS

The primary objective was to determine whether neoadjuvant FOLFOX with selective use of 

chemoradiotherapy would be noninferior to standard neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with 

respect to disease-free survival, defined as survival free from disease recurrence or death 

from any cause, assessed in a time-to-event analysis. Data from patients who did not die or 

have disease recurrence were censored at the date of the last disease evaluation.

Secondary end points included overall survival, local recurrence (in a time-to-event 

analysis), R0 resection, pathological complete response, and toxic effects. Overall survival 

was assessed in a time-to-event analysis as survival free from death from any cause. In 

the time-to-event analysis of local recurrence, isolated local recurrences were identified on 

the basis of their location in the pelvis, irrespective of the mode of detection or whether 

they could be surgically resected. R0 resection was identified on the basis of a pathology 

report showing no involvement of proximal, distal, or radial tumor within 1 mm of any 

surgical margin. Pathological complete response was confirmed if the surgical pathology 

report showed no evidence of tumor.

Adverse events were reported by clinicians using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria and 

Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.15 Patients reported their symptoms and adverse events 

with the use of the patient-reported outcomes version of the CTCAE (PRO-CTCAE).16

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

Noninferiority with respect to the primary end point required a hazard ratio for disease 

recurrence or death with a margin of less than 1.29, corresponding to 5-year disease-

free survival that was 5 percentage points lower in the FOLFOX group than in the 

chemoradiotherapy group. In the original design, the prespecified acceptable maximum 

absolute between-group difference in 3-year disease-free survival was 5 percentage points. 

This noninferiority margin was considered to be clinically important and appropriate by 

more than 50 surgeons and radiation and medical oncologists, as well as by patient 

representatives attending the Alliance Gastrointestinal Oncology Meetings in November 

2010 and May 2011 who participated in interactive polling to establish a noninferiority 

threshold. This margin was maintained with 5-year (instead of 3-year) disease-free survival 

in the revised statistical design. One interim analysis was performed before the major 

revision, and two interim analyses were removed to preserve power with a remaining one-

sided alpha level of 0.049. The revised design required 210 instances of disease recurrence 

or death in order to have 85% power to reject the null hypothesis. Noninferiority of the 

intervention could be claimed if the upper limit of the two-sided 90.2% confidence interval 

of the hazard ratio for disease recurrence or death did not exceed the 1.29 noninferiority 

margin. Hazard ratios and their confidence intervals were estimated with the use of stratified 

Cox proportional-hazards models.

Because noninferiority testing was planned, the analysis of the primary end point was 

based on all the patients who received any dose of treatment (per-protocol population). 

Multivariate analyses were adjusted for age and baseline nodal status (node-positive vs. 

node-negative), given the prognostic importance of these features. Because the statistical 

analysis plan did not include a provision for correcting for multiplicity when conducting 

tests for secondary or other end points, results are reported as point estimates and 95% 

confidence intervals. The widths of the confidence intervals have not been adjusted for 

multiplicity, and therefore the intervals should not be used to infer definitive treatment 

effects for secondary end points. Chi-square and logrank tests were used to compare 

categorical and time-to-event secondary end points, respectively, between the treatment 

groups. Supplemental analyses were based on all the patients who underwent randomization, 

as well as on the per-protocol population that excluded patients who were found to be 

ineligible after randomization. Analyses were conducted with the use of SAS software, 

version 9.4 (SAS Institute).

Results

PATIENTS

From June 2012 through December 2018, a total of 1194 patients with pathologically 

confirmed rectal adenocarcinoma that had been clinically staged as T2 node-positive, T3 

node-negative, or T3 node-positive were randomly assigned to the FOLFOX group (597 

patients) or the chemoradio therapy group (597 patients) at 263 participating institutions. 

After randomization, 66 patients (12 in the FOLFOX group and 54 in the chemoradiotherapy 

group) did not receive any protocol treatment. A total of 1128 patients (585 in the FOLFOX 

group and 543 in the chemoradiotherapy group) began treatment and were included in 

the primary per-protocol analysis (Fig. 1). The pretreatment demographic and clinical 

characteristics of these patients are shown in Table 1. The median follow-up for end points 

was 58 months. The trial database was locked on December 15, 2022, when 227 of the target 

210 events in the analysis of disease-free survival had occurred.

DISEASE-FREE SURVIVAL

FOLFOX with selective use of chemoradiotherapy was found to be noninferior to 

chemoradiotherapy with respect to disease-free survival (hazard ratio for disease recurrence 

or death, 0.92; two-sided 90.2% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 1.14; P = 0.005 for 

noninferiority), and an analysis with adjustment for age and clinical nodal status yielded 

consistent results (Fig. 2A and 2B). Five-year disease-free survival was 80.8% (95% 

CI, 77.9 to 83.7) in the FOLFOX group and 78.6% (95% CI, 75.4 to 81.8) in the 

chemoradiotherapy group. Figure S3 shows a comparison of disease-free survival in 

prespecified subgroups of interest. In a supplementary analysis of disease-free survival 

involving all 1194 patients who underwent randomization, the hazard ratio for disease 

recurrence or death was 0.91 (90.2% CI, 0.73 to 1.13; P = 0.004 for noninferiority); 

results were similar for patients in the per-protocol population who were later found to 

be ineligible. The proportional-hazards assumption was not violated (P = 0.30 by the 

Schoenfeld residuals method).

OVERALL SURVIVAL AND LOCAL RECURRENCE

Five-year overall survival was 89.5% in the FOLFOX group and 90.2% in the 

chemoradiotherapy group (hazard ratio for death, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.44) (Fig. 2C). 

Local recurrence occurred in nine patients in the FOLFOX group and seven patients in the 

chemoradiotherapy group; the incidence of local recurrence at 5 years was 1.8% and 1.6%, 

respectively (hazard ratio, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.44 to 3.16) (Fig. 2D).

PATHOLOGICAL AND SURGICAL SECONDARY END POINTS

Surgical and pathological end points are shown in Table 2. In the per-protocol population, 

resection was pathologically complete (R0) in 90.4% of the patients in the FOLFOX 

group and in 91.2% of those in the chemoradiotherapy group. Among the patients in the 

per-protocol population who underwent surgery, the corresponding percentages were 98.9% 

and 97.1%, respectively (Table 2). Among the patients in the per-protocol population who 

underwent surgery, 117 of 535 patients (21.9%) in the FOLFOX group and 124 of 510 

(24.3%) in the chemoradiotherapy group had a complete pathological response.

NEOADJUVANT TREATMENT DURATION AND ADHERENCE

The median time from randomization to surgery was 19.0 weeks (interquartile range, 17.1 

to 21.1) in the FOLFOX group and 15.6 weeks (interquartile range, 14.6 to 17.0) in the 

chemoradiotherapy group (Table 2). In the FOLFOX group, 555 of 585 patients (94.9%) 

received at least five cycles of neoadjuvant therapy (Table S3A) and 53 of 585 (9.1%) 

received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Eight patients (1.4%) in the FOLFOX group 

received fewer than six cycles of FOLFOX, 38 patients (6.5%) did not meet the clinical 

response threshold of a 20% decrease in primary tumor size, and in 7 cases (1.2% of the 

patients) the treating physician or patient opted for chemoradiotherapy after randomization 

for other reasons. Among the patients who were randomly assigned to the FOLFOX group 

who subsequently received chemoradiotherapy, 52 of 53 (98%) received the full dose of 50.4 

Gy. In the chemoradiotherapy group, 515 of 543 patients (94.8%) completed the full dose of 

50.4 Gy (Table S3B).

POSTOPERATIVE TREATMENT

In the FOLFOX group, 438 of 585 patients (74.9%) received adjuvant chemotherapy; 

348 of these 438 patients (79.5%) received adjuvant FOLFOX for a median of six 

cycles. In the chemoradiotherapy group, 423 of 543 patients (77.9%) received adjuvant 

chemotherapy; 281 of these 423 patients (66.4%) received FOLFOX for a median of 

eight cycles, and an additional 60 patients (14.2%) received postoperative capecitabine 

and oxaliplatin (CAPOX). Ultimately, 61 of 585 patients (10.4%) in the FOLFOX group 

received chemoradiotherapy; 53 patients (9.1%) received it before surgery and 8 (1.4%) 

received it after surgery. The median total duration of treatment (from randomization to the 

last date of postoperative treatment) was 35.6 weeks (interquartile range, 32.9 to 39.3) in the 

FOLFOX group and 37.0 weeks (interquartile range, 34.0 to 40.4) in the chemoradiotherapy 

group (Table S4). Among the patients who underwent resection, 438 of 535 (81.9%) in 

the FOLFOX group and 423 of 510 (82.9%) in the chemoradiotherapy group received any 

postoperative therapy.

SAFETY

Details of clinician-reported toxic effects during neoadjuvant therapy (Table S2A) showed 

a higher incidence of severe (grade ≥3) adverse events in the FOLFOX group than in 

the chemoradiotherapy group (41.0% vs. 22.8%). However, the treatment period was 

twice as long in the FOLFOX group (minimum of 12 weeks, vs. 5.5 weeks in the 

chemoradiotherapy group). Neuropathy was more frequent and severe in the FOLFOX group 

than in the chemoradiotherapy group, and diarrhea was more frequent and severe in the 

chemoradiotherapy group than in the FOLFOX group. In the FOLFOX group, the most 

frequent grade 3 or higher toxic effects of neoadjuvant therapy were neutropenia, pain, and 

hypertension, reported by clinicians for 20.3%, 3.1%, and 2.9% of the patients, respectively. 

In the chemoradiotherapy group, the most frequent grade 3 or higher toxic effects reported 

by clinicians were lymphopenia, diarrhea, and hypertension, in 8.3%, 6.4% and 1.7% of the 

patients, respectively.

Among the patients who received any adjuvant therapy (Table S2B), severe (grade 

≥3) postoperative adverse events occurred in a lower percentage of patients in the 

FOLFOX group than in the chemoradiotherapy group (25.6% vs. 32.6%). The most 

commonly reported postoperative grade 3 or higher toxic effects were neutropenia (in 

3.9% of the patients), diarrhea (in 2.7%), and hyponatremia (in 2.3%) in the FOLFOX 

group and diarrhea (in 5.2%), dehydration (in 4.3%), and lymphopenia (in 4.3%) in 

the chemoradiotherapy group. No unanticipated toxic effects of either FOLFOX or 

chemoradiotherapy were observed.

Discussion

In patients with rectal cancer that had been clinically staged as T2 node-positive, T3 

node-negative, or T3 node-positive who were candidates for sphincter-sparing surgery, 

neoadjuvant FOLFOX and selective use of pelvic chemoradiotherapy was noninferior to the 

current North American standard of neoadjuvant pelvic chemoradiotherapy with respect to 

disease-free survival. Among the patients assigned to receive neoadjuvant FOLFOX, 89.6% 

were ultimately able to avoid receiving chemoradiotherapy. Overall survival was also similar 

with the two treatment strategies.

The percentage of patients free from local recurrence was also similar in the two groups 

and exceeded 98% at 5 years. The major benefit of pelvic radiation therapy that has been 

shown in previous clinical trials is a decrease in the risk of pelvic recurrence.5,6,17,18 The 

very low incidence of local recurrence seen in the FOLFOX group in our trial supports 

the premise underpinning the trial: modern therapies, including staging MRI, chemotherapy 

with oxaliplatin and a fluoropyrimidine, and total mesorectal excision, obviate the need 

for universal application of pelvic radiation. The incidence of local recurrence was even 

lower than that reported in previous trials, most likely because the previous trials, including 

the Neoadjuvant FOLFOX6 Chemotherapy with or without Radiation in Rectal Cancer 

(FOWARC) trial,19 included patients who could not undergo sphincter-sparing surgery or 

who had other high-risk features. In that trial of neoadjuvant therapy, 165 patients were 

randomly assigned to receive FOLFOX and 165 to receive chemoradiotherapy, and 3-year 

disease-free survival was 72.9% and 73.5%, respectively.19

Most trial participants (61.8%) had clinical evidence of enlarged lymph nodes that were 

likely to contain a tumor, and most tumors were in the mid-rectum, with a median distance 

of 8 cm from the anal verge. When the trial was designed in 2011, concern was expressed 

about compromising the low incidence of local recurrence that would be expected to occur 

with administration of neoadjuvant pelvic radiation. Therefore, patients who were thought 

to be at high risk for incomplete resection, such as those with T4 stage disease or low-lying 

tumors, were excluded. Patients with four or more pelvic lymph nodes with a short axis 

measuring more than 10 mm were also excluded, although it is plausible that such patients 

might have the most to gain from neoadjuvant FOLFOX therapy.

Because our trial was launched in 2012, alternative approaches to the treatment of rectal 

cancer have emerged. The Rectal Cancer and Pre-operative Induction Therapy Followed 

by Dedicated Operation (RAPIDO) trial20 evaluated short-course pelvic radiation with 

preoperative CAPOX as compared with chemoradiotherapy and discretionary use of 

postoperative CAPOX. Although treatment for the control groups was similar in the two 

trials, the RAPIDO trial enrolled patients with high-risk tumors (e.g., T4) who were 

excluded from our trial, and differences in eligibility account for the higher incidence of 

recurrence in the RAPIDO trial.20 That trial showed that preoperative short-course radiation 

and chemotherapy were associated with a lower incidence of recurrence than preoperative 

chemoradiotherapy.20 This finding has been attributed to the lower rates of chemotherapy 

use in the chemoradiotherapy group in that trial. The 5-year risk of local recurrence 

was higher with short-course radiation, and this may explain the limited adoption of this 

treatment strategy in North America.21

Although the eligibility criteria used in our trial may limit its generalizability to high-risk 

patients, an analysis of Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results data reveals that patients 

with cancer clinically staged as T2 node-positive, T3 node-negative, or T3 node-positive 

account for more than half the patients with a diagnosis of locally advanced rectal cancer 

in the United States. In our trial, the percentage of patients with a pathological complete 

response was similar in the two groups (21.9% in the FOLFOX group and 24.3% in the 

chemoradiotherapy group), but further research will be necessary to determine whether 

distinctive molecular features predict responsiveness to chemotherapy as compared with 

radiation.

The widespread treatment of average-risk rectal cancer with neoadjuvant 

chemoradiotherapy, which has predominated in North America since publication of the 

German trial in 2004,10 increases the potential for overtreatment. It is plausible that 

the low incidence of recurrence in our trial could have been achieved with up-front 

surgery and selective use of adjuvant chemotherapy or pelvic chemoradiotherapy based on 

surgical pathological assessment. Although our trial shows that it is safe for some patients 

with locally advanced rectal cancer to forgo pelvic radiation, substitution of preoperative 

chemoradiotherapy for preoperative FOLFOX does not reduce the fundamental risk of 

overtreatment.

Because survival and the incidence of recurrence were similar in the two groups, the 

short-term and long-term symptoms reported by patients enrolled in our trial will be

especially important. The incidence of toxic effects was higher during the 12 weeks of 

preoperative treatment with FOLFOX than during the 6 weeks of preoperative treatment 

with chemoradiotherapy. However, during the postoperative period, this pattern reversed, 

with a higher incidence of toxic effects among patients in the chemoradiotherapy group who 

received more postoperative cycles of FOLFOX. Thus, the differences in the incidence of 

toxic effects reflect the timing of FOLFOX administration. The patients who were enrolled 

in our trial were invited to report their symptoms and quality of life, and these data (not 

reported in this article) may enable patients and physicians to tailor treatment to individual 

risk profiles and preferences.22 Pelvic radiation therapy can cause late complications, 

including pelvic fracture, second cancers,9 and myelosuppression, which may impair a 

patient’s ability to receive chemotherapy in the event of recurrence.23 Longer follow-up is 

required in order to evaluate the magnitude of late effects.

The increasing number of treatment options for locally advanced rectal cancer enables 

customized treatment that is based on tumor-specific features. For example, patients whose 

tumors have high microsatellite instability can have a durable complete response with 

immunotherapy alone.24 These newer approaches, including total neoadjuvant therapy25,26 

with the potential for nonoperative management,27 have not yet been evaluated in phase 3 

trials, but they tailor treatment intensity to recurrence risk and may minimize toxic effects 

and the risk of overtreatment. The findings in this trial have extended the therapeutic 

options by showing the noninferiority of neoadjuvant FOLFOX with selective use of 

chemoradiotherapy to the prevailing standard of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. In this 

trial, neoadjuvant FOLFOX was an effective treatment option for patients with T2 node-

positive, T3 node-negative, or T3 node-positive rectal cancer who were candidates for 

sphincter-sparing surgery.

Sites were not required to provide screening logs during the recruitment phase, and therefore 

the number of patients assessed for eligibility is not available. FOLFOX consists of 

fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin; the chemoradiotherapy used in the trial consisted 

of pelvic radiation therapy plus sensitizing chemotherapy with a fluoropyrimidine. Patients 

in the FOLFOX group received six cycles of FOLFOX, with chemoradiotherapy given 

only if the primary tumor decreased in size by less than 20% or if FOLFOX was

Figure 2. Noninferiority Margin and Kaplan–Meier Curves for Disease-free Survival, Overall 
Survival, and Freedom from Local Recurrence.
In Panel A, the dashed line at a hazard ratio of 1.29 indicates the noninferiority 

margin. Values to the left of 1.29 are those for which FOLFOX with selective use 

of chemoradiotherapy would be considered noninferior to chemoradiotherapy alone with 

respect to disease-free survival. The adjusted hazard ratio was estimated with a multivariable 

Cox model with adjustment for age and nodal status (node-positive vs. node-negative). The 

widths of the confidence intervals in Panels C and D have not been adjusted for multiplicity, 

and therefore these intervals should not be used to infer definitive treatment effects. NI 

denotes noninferiority.
