Abstract
Adjuvant chemotherapy has reduced the risk of tumor recurrence and improved sur-
vival in patients with resected colorectal cancer. Potential utility of circulating tumor 
DNA (ctDNA) prior to and post surgery has been reported across various solid tumors. 
We initiated a new type of adaptive platform trials to evaluate the clinical benefits of 
ctDNA analysis and refine precision adjuvant therapy for resectable colorectal can-
cer, named CIRCULATE- Japan including three clinical trials. The GALAXY study is a 
prospectively conducted large- scale registry designed to monitor ctDNA for patients 
with clinical stage II to IV or recurrent colorectal cancer who can undergo complete 
surgical resection. The VEGA trial is a randomized phase III study designed to test 
whether postoperative surgery alone is noninferior to the standard therapy with 
capecitabine plus oxaliplatin for 3 months in patients with high- risk stage II or low- 
risk stage III colon cancer if ctDNA status is negative at week 4 after curative surgery 
in the GALAXY study. The ALTAIR trial is a double- blind, phase III study designed to 
establish the superiority of trifluridine/tipiracil as compared with placebo in patients 
with resected colorectal cancer who show circulating tumor– positive status in the 
GALAXY study. Therefore, CIRCULATE- Japan encompasses both “de- escalation” and 
“escalation” trials for ctDNA- negative and - positive patients, respectively, and helps 
to answer whether measuring ctDNA postoperatively has prognostic and/or predic-
tive value. Our ctDNA- guided adaptive platform trials will accelerate clinical devel-
opment toward further precision oncology in the field of adjuvant therapy. Analysis 
of ctDNA status could be utilized as a predictor of risk stratification for recurrence 
and to monitor the effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy. ctDNA is a promising, 
noninvasive tumor biomarker that can aid in tumor monitoring throughout disease 
management.

1  | INTRODUC TION

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a promising, noninvasive tumor 
biomarker that can aid in tumor monitoring throughout disease man-
agement. Results from GOZILA, a large- scale nationwide registry for 
comprehensive ctDNA sequencing of metastatic colorectal cancer 
(mCRC), reinforced the relevance of matching targetable oncogenic 
drivers to the appropriate targeted therapy for individual patients. 
Thus, ctDNA sequencing can potentially accelerate precision treat-
ment of cancer.1

The monitoring of ctDNA levels in the blood has shown to accu-
rately detect molecular residual disease (MRD) and aid in measuring 
therapeutic effects after curative treatment. Signatera™ (Natera, Inc) 
is a novel, patient- specific, custom- built ctDNA monitoring assay for 
MRD detection (bespoke, mPCR- NGS) that tracks 16 patient- specific 
somatic single- nucleotide variants in the patient's plasma, according 
to the variants identified via whole- exome sequencing of the tumor 
tissue. This assay has shown >95% sensitivity at 0.01% variant allele 
frequency with high specificity.2 Among 122 patients with stages 
I to III CRC, ctDNA was preoperatively detectable in 108 (88.5%). 
After definitive treatment, longitudinal ctDNA analysis identified 
14 (87.5%) of 16 relapses. Furthermore, at postoperative day 30, 
ctDNA- positive patients are significantly more likely to relapse than 
ctDNA- negative patients (hazard ratio, 7.2; 95% confidence inter-
val, 2.7- 19.0; P < .001), regardless of stage. In addition, serial ctDNA 
analyses revealed disease recurrence up to 16.5 months ahead of 
standard- of- care radiologic imaging (mean, 8.7 months).3

We launched a large platform, enrolling patients with resectable 
CRC to evaluate the clinical utility of ctDNA analysis, named the 
CIRCULATE- Japan project (Figure 1). Here, we provide an overview 

of CIRCULATE- Japan, composed of one observational study and 
two randomized phase III trials. This project aims to detect MRD and 
measure treatment responsiveness in resectable CRC using ctDNA 
testing. Ultimately, CIRCULATE- Japan aims to use ctDNA to guide 
the administration of more precise adjuvant therapy treatment reg-
imens in patients.

2  | GAL A X Y STUDY

The GALAXY study is a prospectively conducted large- scale nation-
wide registry designed to monitor ctDNA status for patients with 
clinical stage II to IV CRC who can undergo complete surgical re-
section. Key eligibility criteria are shown in Table 1. A personalized, 
tumor- informed ctDNA assay from Natera, Inc, (bespoke, mPCR- 
NGS), is used in this study. The blood samples will be collected be-
fore surgery and 4, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 96 weeks after surgery. 
Computed tomography (CT) will be performed every 6 months after 
surgery for 7 years. Investigators will receive the results of ctDNA 
assay in a timely manner and, based on ctDNA status, can consider 
patients for enrollment into the VEGA or ALTAIR trials. Residual 
blood and frozen and formalin- fixed tissue samples will be collected 
for further analyses, including RNA sequencing. A total of 2500 pa-
tients will be enrolled.

whether postoperative surgery alone is noninferior to the standard

CAPOX therapy. Key eligibility criteria are (a) primary tumor location 
in the colon; (b) R0 resection performed with colectomy with D2 or 
D3 lymph node dissection, (c) high- risk stage II or low- risk stage III 
(T1- 3 and N1) colon cancer, and (d) ctDNA- negative status at week 4 
after surgery in the GALAXY study (Table 2). Patients are randomly 
assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either undergo surgery alone (observa-
tional group) or receive CAPOX therapy for 3 months (control group: 
1- 14 days of capecitabine, 2000 mg/m2/d and oxaliplatin, 130 mg/
m2/d once every 3 weeks). Randomization is stratified by age (<70 
vs ≥70 years), stage (high- risk stage II vs low- risk stage III), primary 
tumor location (right- sided vs left- sided vs rectosigmoid colon), and 
RAS status (mutant vs wild type). The primary endpoint is disease 
free survival (DFS). Key secondary endpoints include time to treat-
ment failure, overall survival, adverse events, relative dose intensity, 

and ctDNA status at each timepoint. Contrast medium– enhanced CT 
is performed once every 6 months for up to 7 years after enrollment.

The 3- year DFS rate among standard CAPOX patients is assumed 
to be 85%. However, the reported DFS hazard ratio for postoper-
ative ctDNA- positive vs ctDNA- negative patients is 7.24,5, and the 
ctDNA- positive rate is assumed to be 10%. Based on these previous 
data, we assume that the 3- year DFS rate among ctDNA- negative 
patients will be 91%. With an acceptable 3% decrease in 3- year DFS 
(ie, from 91% to 88%) associated with switching to no chemother-
apy, which corresponds to a noninferiority margin of 1.355, a total of 
1240 (620 per arm) will provide a statistical power of 70% to test the 
noninferiority hypothesis at a one- sided significance level of 10%, 
with enrollment and follow- up periods of 2 and 3 years, respectively. 
This trial has been registered in the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials 
(jRCT1031200006).

4  | ALTAIR TRIAL

The ALTAIR trial is a randomized, double- blind, phase III study de-
signed to establish the superiority of trifluridine/tipiracil (FTD/TPI) 
as compared with placebo in patients with CRC who show ctDNA- 
positive status with the Signatera® assay at any time after curative 
resection for up to 2 years after surgery. Key eligibility criteria are 
(a) having undergone radical resection of primary and/or metastatic 
tumors, (b) a history of standard adjuvant chemotherapy, (c) posi-
tive ctDNA status within the previous 3 months at any time postop-
eratively, and (d) no obvious relapse confirmed by chest, abdominal, 
and pelvic CT scans (Table 3). Patients will be randomly assigned in 
a 1:1 ratio to receive either 6 months of oral FTD/TPI (35 mg/m2 
twice daily on days 1- 5 and days 8- 12 in a 28- day cycle) or a match-
ing course of placebo. Randomization is stratified by age (<70 vs 
≥70 years), stage (stage II or lower vs stage III vs stage IV or M1), 
primary tumor location (right- sided vs left- sided colon vs rectum), 
ctDNA status at 1 month (positive vs negative or unmeasurable), and 
institution. The primary endpoint is DFS. Key secondary endpoints 
include rate of conversion from positive to negative ctDNA status, 
overall survival, adverse events, and quality of life.

The mean time from ctDNA- positive status to detectable recur-
rence on CT has been reported to be 8.7 months.3 Based on the 
data, we assume that the median DFS in the placebo group will be 
approximately 8 months. A total of 240 patients (120 per arm) will 
provide 80% power to detect an expected DFS hazard ratio of 0.667 
at two- sided significance level of .05, with an enrollment period of 
2 years and a follow- up period of 1 year. This trial has been regis-
tered in the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (JapicCTI- 205363) and 
at Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04457297).

followed by two ctDNA- guided phase III trials (VEGA and ALTAIR), 
which aim to refine adjuvant therapy in patients with resectable 
CRC. In the GALAXY study, ctDNA testing is performed for MRD 
detection. Patients with stage II or III colon cancer and negative 
MRD status 4 weeks after resection are enrolled in the VEGA study, 
whereas patients with positive MRD status at any time after stand-
ard adjuvant therapy are enrolled in the ALTAIR study. CIRCULATE- 
Japan will thus encompass both “de- escalation” and “escalation” 
trials for ctDNA- negative and - positive patients, respectively, and 

help to answer whether measuring ctDNA postoperatively has 
prognostic and/or predictive value in patients with resectable CRC.

The GALAXY trial also aims to generate a large dataset with 
high- quality clinical data and comprehensive genomic profiling 
(whole- exome sequencing) of resected tumor tissue. Real- world 
evidence based on high- quality registries and longitudinal health 
care databases outside of randomized control trials (RCTs) has

population.6 The data collected in the GALAXY study could be 
used as a reference, especially in new molecularly stratified treat-
ments and/or to further investigate the MRD- positive space.

The clinical question of the VEGA trial is whether or not to elimi-
nate an immediate adjuvant chemotherapy for patients who are less 
likely to benefit from it. If the noninferiority of surgery alone against 
chemotherapy is proven, it will become the new standard of care in 
patients with MRD- negative status 4 weeks after surgery for high- 
risk stage II or low- risk stage III colon cancer. This would represent a 
substantial treatment paradigm shift. The key objective of the VEGA 
trial is to provide individual patient data into a multinational collab-
orative project, called “Circulate IDEA,” which we will plan to launch 
to compare surgery alone vs adjuvant CAPOX in this population. We 
will design the Circulate IDEA to prospectively combine and analyze 
data from several trials as in the original IDEA Collaboration and to 
provide more than 80% of statistical power to test noninferiority of 
surgery alone against adjuvant CAPOX at a one- sided significance 
level of 2.5%.

The aim of the ALTAIR trial is to establish the clinical significance 
of early intervention in patients with MRD at an early stage by mon-
itoring ctDNA status during the surveillance period. FTD/TPI exhib-
its antitumor effects against 5- fluorouracil– resistant tumors that are 
similar to those exerted in 5- fluorouracil– sensitive tumors and has 
demonstrated a survival benefit in chemotherapy- refractory mCRC 
even when disease has been refractory to 5- fluorouracil– containing 
regimens.7 Thus, we expect FTD/TPI to have antitumor effect on 
any existing MRD, even on tumors refractory to standard adjuvant 
therapy, including 5- fluorouracil. This trial will be of great value be-
cause there is no confirmative prospective trial developing therapy 
for resected CRC patients with ctDNA- positive status.

In summary, using a ctDNA assay that has high sensitivity and 
specificity for detecting MRD is most likely to enable suitable pa-
tients to receive appropriate adjuvant therapy. Our ctDNA- guided 
adaptive platform trials will accelerate clinical development toward 
further precision oncology in the field of adjuvant therapy. In ad-
dition, the resulting CIRCULATE- Japan database, consisting of mul-
tiomics data, ctDNA results, and clinical outcomes, will serve as a 
reference in further development of adjuvant therapy but also con-
tribute to the understanding of the nature of cancer itself or through 
international harmonization with other data platforms.
