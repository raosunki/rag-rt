Abstract

Background: Evidence is lacking regarding the earliest timing of initiating adjuvant chemotherapy to maximize its efficacy safely. A 
trial was designed and conducted to evaluate the safety and oncological efficacy of early adjuvant chemotherapy compared with 
conventional adjuvant chemotherapy. The short-term outcomes are reported here.

Methods: A multicentre, randomized (1 : 1), open-label, phase III trial was conducted comparing early adjuvant chemotherapy with 
conventional adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with stage III colon cancer. Patients who underwent radical surgery who had 
stage III colon cancer confirmed by histopathological assessment were screened and randomized into the early adjuvant 
chemotherapy arm or the conventional adjuvant chemotherapy arm. The primary endpoint was 3-year disease-free survival. The 
adjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFOX was delivered between postoperative day 10 and 14 in the early adjuvant chemotherapy arm, 
and between postoperative day 24 and 28 in the conventional adjuvant chemotherapy arm. Toxicity and quality of life were evaluated.

Results: Between 9 September 2011 and 6 March 2020, 443 patients consented to randomization at eight sites. The intention-to-treat 
population included 423 patients (209 in the early adjuvant chemotherapy arm and 214 in the conventional adjuvant chemotherapy 
arm), and the safety population included 380 patients (192 in the early adjuvant chemotherapy arm and 188 in the conventional 
adjuvant chemotherapy arm). There was no statistically significant difference in overall toxicity (28.1 per cent in the early adjuvant 
chemotherapy arm and 28.2 per cent in the conventional adjuvant chemotherapy arm, P = 0.244), surgical complications, and 
quality of life between the two arms.

Conclusion: Adjuvant chemotherapy can be safely initiated 2 weeks after surgery with toxicity and quality of life comparable to 
conventional adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III colon cancer.

Introduction
Adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) after radical surgery is the current 

standard treatment for high-risk stage II and III colon cancer with 

a survival benefit due to eradication of micrometastases1–3. 

Initiating AC beyond 8 weeks after surgery is associated with 

worse overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS)4–13. It 

is recommended that AC is initiated within 8 weeks after surgery; 

however, the earliest time that it can safely be commenced is not 

yet defined.
Many preclinical studies suggest that surgery due to manipulation 

of the tumour may affect tumour kinetics, facilitate circulation of 

tumour cells, and increase metastatic potential14. A postoperative 
increase in angiogenesis and oncogenic growth factors in 
immunocompromised status can potentiate the movement and 
growth of residual tumour cells15–17. Therefore, theoretically, AC 
should be initiated as soon as possible after surgery to maximize 
its efficacy.

Although the negative impact of delaying AC is evident, 
initiating AC immediately after surgery for colon cancer has 
been avoided. This is due to concerns that cytotoxic agents can 
compromise tissue healing of wounds and the anastomosis. 
Patients need enough time to recover to be able to tolerate 
cytotoxic therapy safely. However, the postoperative recovery

interval has been reduced due to minimally invasive surgery and 
Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols. Therefore, 
more patients should be physiologically able to tolerate AC 
earlier than in the past.

Most previous studies have focused on how long you can delay 
AC rather than how early is safe. Therefore, a prospective 
randomized trial was designed and conducted to evaluate the 
safety and oncological efficacy of early AC (EAC) compared with 
conventional AC (CAC). In this study, the short-term outcomes 
of this trial are reported.

Methods
Study design and participants
A multicentre, randomized (1 : 1), open-label, phase III trial was 
conducted comparing EAC with CAC in patients with stage III 
colon cancer. Patients were recruited from eight centres in 
South Korea. All centres were tertiary medical institutes with 
sub-specialist colorectal surgeons. Patients with stage III colon 
cancer were screened after surgery to determine whether they 
met the inclusion criteria: age greater than or equal to 18 years 
with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance 
status 0–2; histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the 
colon (tumours greater than 12 cm from the anal verge or above 
the peritoneal reflection); undergone standard, minimally 
invasive, curative R0 resection with D3 lymphadenectomy; 
discharged within 10 days after surgery; stage III based on the 
Seventh Edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual; fully 
recovered hepatic, renal, and haematological function, as 
assessed by serum chemistry with calculated creatinine 
clearance, liver function test, and full blood cell count; and able 
to understand and willing to consent. The main exclusion 
criteria were: rectal cancer; metastatic or radically unresectable 
disease; stage I or II colon cancer based on the Seventh Edition 
of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual; any contraindication for 
chemotherapy, including age greater than 85 years or life 
expectancy under 5 years due to non-cancer-related disease; 
hypersensitivity to treatment component(s); unable to be 
discharged 10 days after surgery due to any postoperative 
complications; emergency operation for tumour obstruction or 
perforation; history or presence of synchronous malignancy; 
previous chemotherapy; and being pregnant or breastfeeding.

The study was conducted as per the Declaration of Helsinki and 
the Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The study protocol was 
approved by the Kyungpook National University Hospital Ethics 
Committee (version 1.3) on 21 January 2012, and its equivalent 
in other participating institutions. All participants provided 
written informed consent before enrolment. Trial oversight 
was maintained by a combined trial steering committee and a 
data monitoring committee. This study was registered at 
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01460589).

Randomization and procedure protocol
The anaesthetic evaluation and patient information regarding the 
operative procedure were performed according to the local 
practices of each investigation centre. Radical surgery was 
performed as per the oncological quality criteria for resection. 
Preoperative and postoperative data were reported on specific 
forms. If the histological assessment confirmed stage III disease 
and the patient met the inclusion criteria, eligible patients were 
randomly assigned (1 : 1) to the EAC arm or the CAC arm. The 
randomization sequence was concealed from the investigators, 
and randomization was performed using a web-based software 

platform (Velos, Fermont, CA, USA) and centrally coordinated by 
the Clinical Research Coordination Centre of the Kyungpook 
National University Cancer Centre (Daegu, Korea).

The assigned AC was delivered between postoperative day 
(POD) 10 and 14 in the EAC arm, and between POD 24 and 28 in 
the CAC arm. The AC regimen was FOLFOX, which comprised 
oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, leucovorin 200 mg/m2, and bolus 
fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 on day 1, and infusion of fluorouracil 
2400 mg/m2 over 46 h, every 2 weeks, for a total of 12 cycles. If 
clinically indicated based on the investigator’s discretion, the 
doses of chemotherapeutic drugs were reduced by 75 per cent at 
the start.

Toxicity was evaluated based on Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 4.0, and dose modifications were 
based on the most severe adverse events and the investigator’s 
discretion. Adverse events were monitored during and after the 
study treatment, and a complete laboratory examination was 
performed on day 1 of each treatment cycle. For treatment-related 
adverse events of grade 1, treatment was continued at the total 
dose. For grade 2, treatment was withheld and restarted after 
recovery to grade 1. The dose was reduced for grade 3 adverse 
events and grade 4 stomatitis with a delay in the treatment 
schedule, if necessary. Treatment was discontinued in the event 
of any documented disease recurrence, grade 4 or 5 adverse 
events, or a patient’s refusal.

After completing the protocol treatment, patients were 
followed up according to a predefined surveillance schedule 
until recurrence, development of another malignancy, or death. 
Carcinoembryonic antigen level assessment with a general 
blood test and abdominopelvic CT scans were performed every 3 
to 6 months for the first 2 years and every 6 months thereafter. 
Chest CT scans were performed every 8 to 12 months. A 
colonoscopy was routinely performed 1 year and 5 years after 
surgery.

Endpoints
The primary endpoint was 3-year DFS, defined as the time from 
the date of the operation to the earliest date of recurrence.

The secondary endpoint was OS, defined as the time from the date 
of the operation to the date of death due to all causes or the date of 
the last follow-up, chemotherapy-related adverse events according 
to CTCAE 4.0, surgical complications during chemotherapy 
according to the Clavien–Dindo classification, and quality of Life 
(QoL) assessment according to the European Organization for 
Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire 
(EORTC QLQ) C30. The patients completed baseline questionnaires 
after providing consent and before initiating AC. When patients 
visited the outpatient clinic, follow-up questionnaires were 
administered to patients 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery.

The review of case report forms was conducted annually for 
quality control by the Kyungpook National University Cancer 
Centre (Daegu, Korea).

Statistics
The expected 3-year DFS with CAC was 72 per cent based on a 
literature review9. A 10 per cent gain in 3-year DFS was 
predicted in the EAC arm compared with the CAC arm (82 versus 
72 per cent respectively). For a statistical power of 80 per cent 
for the superiority hypothesis at a one-sided significance level of 
0.05, the sample size was calculated as 220 patients in each 
arm, assuming that 14 per cent of patients were lost to 
follow-up. PASS 11™ software (NCSS, Kaysville, UT, USA) was 
used to compute the sample size.

All randomized patients were defined as the intention-to-treat 
(ITT) population. Patients with protocol violations, which meant 
the date of initiating chemotherapy did not meet the protocol, 
were excluded from the per-protocol population. Safety 
analyses were performed on the safety population, which meant 
all patients who received at least one cycle of chemotherapy 
after randomization. QoL analyses were performed on patients 
in the safety population who answered QoL questionnaires at 
baseline and follow-up.

The χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test was used for comparing 
categorical variables, and Student’s t test or the Mann–Whitney U 
test was used to compare continuous variables, depending on the 
distribution. The outcomes of EORTC QLQ C30 were described 
using means and standard errors of means. Questionnaire 
responses were collected five times from baseline to 12 months 
after surgery. Patients who completed at least one questionnaire 
response after the baseline time point were included in the 
analysis irrespective of the interval. A mixed model for repeated 
measures (MMRM) with the assumption of an unconstructed 
covariance structure for repeated measurements was applied for 
the analysis. The least-square mean estimates were calculated 
for post-hoc analysis to compare the two arms at each interval.

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS® (IBM, Armonk, 
NY, USA; version 26). All P values were reported as two-sided and 
results with P < 0.050 were considered statistically significant.

Results
Patient and disease characteristics
Between 9 September 2011 and 6 March 6 2020, 443 patients 
consented to randomization at eight sites; 221 and 222 patients 
were allocated to the EAC arm and the CAC arm respectively 
(Fig. 1). After randomization, 20 patients (12 in the EAC arm and 8 
in the CAC arm) withdrew consent. The ITT population included 
423 patients (209 in the EAC arm and 214 in the CAC arm).

A total of 43 patients (17 in the EAC arm and 26 in the CAC arm) 
did not receive treatment as per the study protocol. In the EAC 
arm, two patients could not initiate AC due to the late surgical 
complications, and 39 patients (15 in the EAC arm and 24 in the 
CAC arm) received other regimens for AC, including intravenous 
fluorouracil/leucovorin (FL), oral capecitabine, and oxaliplatin 
with oral capecitabine. The safety population included 380 
patients (192 in the EAC arm and 188 in the CAC arm) because 
safety data were missing for 2 patients in the CAC arm. The QoL 
population included 280 patients (148 in the EAC arm and 132 in 
the CAC arm) because QoL data were missing for 100 patients 
(44 in the EAC arm and 56 in the CAC arm) among the safety 
population.

The baseline and pathological characteristics of the ITT 
population, the safety population, and the QoL population are 
shown in Table 1. All patient and tumour characteristics were 
evenly distributed in the two arms in all populations.

Results of adjuvant chemotherapy and toxicity
The median times from operation to initiating AC were 13 (range 
4–43) days in the EAC arm and 29 (range 17–53) days in the CAC 
arm (safety population) (P < 0.001). In the QoL population these 
were 13 (range 10–14) days in the EAC arm and 28 (range 24–28) 
days in the CAC arm (P < 0.001) (Table 2). In the safety 
population, 27 patients (14 per cent) in the EAC arm initiated AC 
after 14 days (postoperative general weakness in 5 patients, late 
visit in 12 patients, and delay of the appointment with an 
oncologist or vascular access in ten patients).

The median number of administered cycles and completeness 
of chemotherapy, including the rate of completion without dose 
reduction or delay, the rate of completion with dose reduction 
or delay, the rate of completion of FL with discontinuation of 
oxaliplatin, and the rate of discontinuation of chemotherapy, 
were similar between the two arms. The most common reason 
for discontinuation of chemotherapy was toxicity in both arms, 
and five patients in the CAC arm had to discontinue the study

CAC arm, there was no statistically significant difference (1.0 per 
cent in the EAC arm versus 0.0 per cent in the CAC arm, P = 0.870).

The relative dose intensities of oxaliplatin in the two arms were 
similar and decreased to 80 per cent at the seventh cycle of AC in 
both arms (Table 3).

Details of toxicity are presented in Table S1. The percentage of 
patients who experienced grade 3 or higher toxicity was similar 
(28.1 per cent in the EAC arm and 28.2 per cent in the CAC arm, 
P = 0.244). There was no difference in the overall or individual 
toxicity between the two arms, except for alopecia. The rate of 
grade 1–2 alopecia was higher in the EAC arm (11 per cent versus 
5 per cent in the CAC arm, P = 0.045), but there was no grade 3 
alopecia in either arm.

Quality of life
The QoL data are shown in Table S2 and Fig. 2. There were no 
differences in overall health, functions, and symptoms between 
the two arms at any time point. These parameters were 
significantly improved at 12 months post-surgery compared 
with baseline in both arms.

Discussion
Traditionally, AC is initiated between 4 and 8 weeks after radical 
surgery for colon cancer to achieve the balance between 
postoperative recovery and therapeutic effect. Although many 
studies have reported a correlation between poor prognosis and 
late initiation of AC (more than 8 weeks postoperatively)4–13, 
there is little research on the efficacy of immediate early 
initiation of AC. Moreover, the number of patients who began AC 
before 2 weeks was minimal (less than 0.5 per cent) in most 
studies. A meta-analysis by Biagi et al.9 demonstrated that both

OS and DFS decreased significantly every 4 weeks, and they 
recommended further validation of the intuitive concept of 
EAC. Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the earliest 
and safest timing of AC to obtain the maximal oncological 
effect using a prospective randomized method. As a result, it 
was demonstrated that EAC within 2 weeks was safe and 
tolerable in most patients, with equal toxicity, completeness of 
treatment, relative dose intensity of oxaliplatin, and QoL 
compared with CAC.

In the era of minimally invasive surgery and ERAS, it is 
necessary to re-evaluate traditional chemotherapy regimens. 
The traditional concept of AC after a minimum of 4 weeks after 
surgery was formed several decades ago when open surgery 
was generally performed for gastrointestinal cancers. This 
demanded longer hospitalization, recovery time (until returning 
to oral intake), and wound management. However, minimally 
invasive surgery for colorectal cancer has now become the 
standard of care for the majority of patients18–21 with the 
benefits of faster postoperative recovery and oncologically 
equivalent outcomes for any stage of cancer compared with 
open surgery22. Recently, several studies reported that robotic 
colectomy demonstrated a lower rate of conversion and a 
shorter hospitalization interval compared with laparoscopic 
colectomy23,24. Owing to the development of surgical 
techniques, the concept of ERAS has been introduced globally 
and has changed traditional postoperative care significantly. 
Changes throughout the multimodal aspects of perioperative 
management (including pre-admission counselling, bowel 
preparation, fluid therapy, nutritional support, prophylaxis 
against infection and thromboembolism, management during 
anaesthesia, and postoperative analgesia) have shortened times 
for return to a normal diet, recovery with less complications, 
and hospitalization25. Numerous studies have reported that 
ERAS significantly reduces the length of stay (to within 1 week), 
as well as complication and readmission rates26–28. Patients 
recover sooner from the surgical insult compared with patients 
historically.

Anastomotic leakage, one of the worst complications following 
colorectal surgery, is usually diagnosed between 3 and 8 days 
after surgery22, even though the timing of detection can vary 
according to a patient’s status. Additionally, anastomotic 
leakage after ileocolic or colocolic anastomosis is relatively 
uncommon compared with rectal cancer surgery and is usually 
detected immediately after surgery. Surgical site infection and 
pulmonary complications are usually reported to be diagnosed 
about 4 and 10 days postoperatively respectively29. The risk 
of thromboembolic events for normal patients is known to 
diminish after ambulation, and pharmacological prophylaxis 
for normal patients is recommended during admission, 
generally within 1 week30. Therefore, a minimum of 2 weeks 
from surgery to the initiation of AC was considered appropriate 
for EAC.

A potential concern after the early introduction of cytotoxic 
agents is late anastomotic complications. In this study, two 
patients in the EAC arm showed leakage on POD 16 and a stricture 
on POD 18 respectively, and both required surgical intervention. 
Although it is generally considered that anastomotic healing is 
completed by POD 10–12, the rate of late anastomotic leakage 
after general recovery was reported to be 6 to 7.7 per cent in 
colorectal resection, regardless of the timing of AC31,32. As there 
was no statistically significant difference in surgical complications 
between the two arms, it is considered that the early initiation of 
AC did not increase the rate of surgical complications. However, 

the delay of AC needs to be considered if there is evidence of 
surgical complications before AC.

There were five cases of recurrence during AC in the CAC arm 
and no cases in the EAC arm. These findings need to be 
evaluated further with longer-term follow-up and to investigate 
if patients with adverse features should be considered for earlier 
AC.

In the present study, postoperative QoL was investigated 
to evaluate if a shorter interval between surgery and following 
AC impairs general condition and daily living according to a 
patient’s subjective feelings, in addition to surgical 
complications. AC affects the QoL of patients who undergo 
colon cancer surgery, not only during AC, but also after its 
completion33,34. The impaired QoL is mainly related to 
chemotherapeutic toxicity and its grade during AC35. Iveson 
et al.34 reported that QoL declined during AC and started 
recovering 1 month after the last AC. Therefore, QoL was 
investigated for 1 year after surgery. In the present study, there 
was no statistically significant difference in QoL and its recovery 
pattern between the two arms. Both were worst during AC and 
fully recovered at 12 months after surgery. This study 
demonstrated that EAC within 2 weeks did not compromise 
surgical, medical, mental, or functional outcomes.

This study has limitations. The time interval between the 
two arms according to the study design was only 2 weeks. Due 
to the short interval between the two arms and various 
medical and personnel issues, there was an overlap of the 
time interval. Consequently, interpretation of the results 
should be made with some caution as 58 patients (25 in the 
EAC arm and 33 in the CAC arm) were excluded from 
the safety analyses because of protocol violations. Among 
them, 15 patients were enrolled in the study by surgeons 
immediately after recovery from surgery, but all declined to 
receive chemotherapy after discussions with medical 
oncologists. Another 40 patients chose a chemotherapy 
regimen other than FOLFOX. However, the outcomes of 
variables (chemotherapy dose, compliance, and toxicities) 
analysed in the safety population were similar when analyses 
including those patients were performed.

This study was performed in tertiary hospitals with 
sub-specialist colorectal surgeons, high rates of minimally 
invasive surgery, and low rates of surgical complications. This 
might impact the generalizability of the results to other centres 
nationally or internationally. Early initiation of AC is not 
appropriate for all patients and may not be appropriate for 
those who have open surgery, frail patients, or those with 
postoperative complications.
