Abstract
Background and Objectives
Primary mitochondrial myopathies (PMMs) encompass a group of genetic disorders that impair
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, adversely affecting physical function, exercise capacity,
and quality of life (QoL). Current PMM standards of care address symptoms, with limited clinical
impact, constituting a significant therapeutic unmet need. We present data fromMMPOWER-3,
a pivotal, phase-3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that evaluated the
efficacy and safety of elamipretide in participants with genetically confirmed PMM.

Methods
After screening, eligible participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either 24 weeks of elamipretide
at a dose of 40 mg/d or placebo subcutaneously. Primary efficacy endpoints included change from
baseline to week 24 on the distance walked on the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and total fatigue on
the Primary Mitochondrial Myopathy Symptom Assessment (PMMSA). Secondary endpoints
includedmost bothersome symptom score on the PMMSA,NeuroQoLFatigue Short-Form scores,
and the patient global impression and clinician global impression of PMM symptoms.

Results
Participants (N = 218) were randomized (n = 109 elamipretide; n = 109 placebo). The m0ean
age was 45.6 years (64% women; 94% White). Most of the participants (n = 162 [74%]) had
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) alteration, with the remainder having nuclear DNA (nDNA)
defects. At screening, the most frequent bothersome PMM symptom on the PMMSA was

tiredness during activities (28.9%). At baseline, the mean distance walked on the 6MWT was 336.7 ± 81.2 meters, the mean
score for total fatigue on the PMMSA was 10.6 ± 2.5, and the mean T score for the Neuro-QoL Fatigue Short-Form was 54.7 ±
7.5. The study did not meet its primary endpoints assessing changes in the 6MWT and PMMSA total fatigue score (TFS).
Between the participants receiving elamipretide and those receiving placebo, the difference in the least squares mean (SE) from
baseline to week 24 on distance walked on the 6MWT was −3.2 (95% CI −18.7 to 12.3; p = 0.69) meters, and on the PMMSA,
the total fatigue score was −0.07 (95% CI −0.10 to 0.26; p = 0.37). Elamipretide treatment was well-tolerated with most adverse
events being mild to moderate in severity.

Discussion
Subcutaneous elamipretide treatment did not improve outcomes in the 6MWT and PMMSA TFS in patients with PMM.
However, this phase-3 study demonstrated that subcutaneous elamipretide is well-tolerated.

Trial Registration Information
Trial registered with clinicaltrials.gov, Clinical Trials Identifier: NCT03323749; submitted on October 12, 2017; first patient
enrolled October 9, 2017. clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03323749?term = elamipretide&draw = 2&rank = 9.

Classification of Evidence
This study provides Class I evidence that elamipretide does not improve the 6MWT or fatigue at 24 weeks compared with
placebo in patients with primary mitochondrial myopathy.

A consensus of experts define primary mitochondrial myop-
athies (PMMs) as a diverse group of genetically confirmed
disorders of the mitochondria, affecting predominantly, but
not exclusively, skeletal muscle, thereby adversely affecting
physical function and quality of life.1,2 The result is muscle
weakness, muscle atrophy, limited exercise capacity, and
symptoms of fatigue and pain.1,2 PMM severity is variable, but
the progressive reduction in exercise capacity eventually im-
pairs participants’ ability to perform activities of daily living.3-5

Primary mitochondrial diseases (PMDs) caused by both mito-
chondrial (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA (nDNA) alteration are
among the most common inherited metabolic disorders.2 PMDs
have been reported to affect at least 1 in 4,300 people in the
general population6 or an estimated 40,000 total individuals in the
United States.6 Because most patients with PMDs are reported to
experience PMM, the prevalence of PMMspecifically is estimated
to be slightly less than the overall prevalence of all PMDs (aside
from patients with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy [LHON])
who do not experience a skeletal muscle component).6,7

Currently, available standards of care primarily use dietary
supplements that have limited clinical impact.8 Therefore, a
significant unmet clinical need for new therapies exists.8

However, there have been a number of historical challenges to

the development of mitochondrial therapies, including the
lack of a specific molecular target in mitochondria to promote
adenosine triphosphate synthesis and a drug development
process that is driven by disease-specific approaches.9

Elamipretide is an investigational mitochondrial-targeting
agent in development for treating patients with a variety of
mitochondrial diseases.10-13 Elamipretide is a water-soluble,
aromatic, cationic, mitochondria-targeting tetrapeptide that
readily penetrates and transiently localizes to the inner mito-
chondrial membrane where it associates with cardiolipin to
improve membrane stability and restore supercomplex for-
mation, thereby enhancing adenosine triphosphate synthesis
in several organs including the heart, kidney, neurons, and
skeletal muscle, and reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production.10,13-26 High-resolution respirometry studies in
human and animal models of myopathy have demonstrated
elamipretide-mediated improvement of respiration across var-
ious electron transport chain complexes.27,28 These effects
corresponded with significantly improved mitochondrial and
cristae morphology,27 which are known to be altered across
many mitochondrial myopathies.29

The elamipretide clinical development program included
MMPOWER-1 and MMPOWER-2, whereby treatment with

elamipretide demonstrated meaningful improvements in
patient-reported outcomes (PROs) for patients with con-
firmed PMM.10,11 MMPOWER-3 was a pivotal, phase 3,
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial
designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 40 mg of ela-
mipretide subcutaneously (SC) once daily for 24 weeks as a
treatment for patients with PMM using the 6-minute walk test
(6MWT) and fatigue questionnaires as outcome measures.
MMPOWER-3 was designed to provide important baseline
characteristics and data on how treatment may affect func-
tional changes and PROs.

Methods
Study Design and Participants
MMPOWER-3 was a 24-week , randomized, double-blind,
parallel-group, placebo-controlled clinical trial for adults with
PMM conducted at 27 clinical research centers in 7 countries
(Canada, Denmark, England, Germany, Hungary, Italy, and
the United States).

MMPOWER-3 trial participants were primarily identified by
the RePOWER registry, a global, prospective, noninterven-
tional registry enrolling 413 ambulatory individuals 16–80
years of age with signs and/or symptoms of PMM.30 Registry
individuals provided demographic, genetic/phenotypic, func-
tional, and clinical assessments, which were used to confirm
genotypic-phenotypic correlations and identify potential phase
3 trial participants before MMPOWER-3 screening.30

After screening (7–28 days), eligible participants were ran-
domized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 24-weeks of once-daily
SC dosing of 40 mg of elamipretide or placebo. Study drug or
placebo was self-administered subcutaneously by trained
participants or their caregivers, at rotating sites around 4
quadrants of the abdomen or the thighs. Treatment began at
the baseline visit with assessments at weeks 4, 12, and 24.

Eligible participants were those between 16 years or older and
80 years or younger (18 years or older in Germany), di-
agnosed with PMM with a confirmed sequence alteration
affecting mitochondrial function, and those with symptoms
(i.e., exercise intolerance, fatigue, muscle weakness) and/or
physical examination findings consistent with a myopathy as
the predominant manifestation of their mitochondrial disease.
In addition, participants had to be willing and able to provide
consent and adhere to trial requirements for inclusion. An
acceptable form of birth control was required of participants
of childbearing potential during the study.

Participants walking <100 meters or >450 meters during the
6MWT at screening/baseline were also excluded. Participants
were not allowed to have had a recent (within 30 days) or
planned hospitalization/procedure and were excluded if they
had a clinically significant end-organ damage in the opinion of
the investigator.30

Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations,
and Patient Consents
MMPOWER-3 was conducted in accordance with in-
ternational ethics guidelines, including the Declaration of
Helsinki, Council for International Organizations of Medical
Sciences International Ethical Guidelines, ICH GCP guide-
lines, and all applicable laws and regulations. The study was
approved by institutional review boards, and all participants
provided written informed consent (clinicaltrials.gov, Clinical
Trials Identifier: NCT03323749.).

Randomization and Masking
Assignment to treatment groups within each cohort for the
randomized portion of the study was determined by a
computer-generated random sequence using an Interactive
Web-Response System to assign identical glass vials con-
taining either the elamipretide or a placebo, which consisted
of the same formulation without elamipretide. Participants
were stratified by the subclassification of the specific sequence
alteration causing their PMM, as determined by the adjudi-
cation committee formed to review and confirm eligibility for
study enrollment.3 The pharmacists, investigators and trial
staff, sponsor, and participants were blinded to treatment.

Study Assessments and Procedures
MMPOWER-3 was designed to assess the safety and efficacy
of elamipretide through primary and secondary clinical study
endpoints.

Efficacy Assessments
Coprimary endpoints evaluated the effect of elamipretide for
24 weeks including the distance walked (in meters) on the
6MWT and the total fatigue score on the Primary Mito-
chondrial Myopathy Symptom Assessment (PMMSA), pre-
viously described in detail.31 The full PMMSA assesses the
severity of 10 of the most common symptoms of PMM using
the following 4-point scale (not at all1 to severe4; described
later). PMMSA total fatigue score (TFS) focuses on myo-
pathic symptoms most commonly associated with PMM
(severity of tiredness and muscle weakness at rest and during
activities, as described by participants).

Most bothersome symptom score on the PMMSA and the
NeuroQoL Short-Form fatigue scores were secondary end-
points. The Neuro-QoL evaluates and monitors sensations
ranging from tiredness to an overwhelming, debilitating, and
sustained sense of exhaustion that decreases capacity for
physical, functional, social, and mental activities, based on a
5-point scale (1 = never, 2 = rarely, 3 = sometimes, 4 = often,
and 5 = always).

Other secondary endpoints included the patient global im-
pression (PGI) and clinician global impression (CGI) of
PMM symptoms. PGI and CGI assess patient and clinician
overall assessment of the severity of patients’ symptoms re-
lated to PMM on a 5-point scaled question scored 0 to 4 (0 =
none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, and 4 = very Severe)

and changes to their symptoms on a 7-point scale scored −3 to
3 (−3 = very much worse, −2 = moderately worse, −1 = a little
worse, 0 = no change, 1 = a little better, 2 = moderately better,
and 3 = very much better).

The PMMSA was performed during screening, baseline, and
daily throughout the 24-week study period. Other efficacy
endpoints were performed at screening, baseline, and at weeks
4, 12, and 24 of randomized treatment.

Safety Assessments
Safety and tolerability of elamipretide at a dose of 40 mg/d SC
were assessed through recording of adverse events (AEs),
ascertained through self-report, vital signs, physical examina-
tion, ECGs, and clinical laboratory evaluations. Adverse
events were assessed for severity and relationship to study
medication throughout the 24-week study. Safety measures
were assessed during screening, baseline and weeks 4, 12,
and 24.

Statistical Analysis
A sample size of 202 participants, with 101 participants in
each treatment arm, was determined to provide 90% power to
detect a 30-meter difference between treatment groups in the
6MWT and a 90% power to detect a 1-unit difference in the
PMMSA TFS. This was assuming standard deviations of 60
meters for 6MWT and 2 units for the PMMSA TFS, at an
alpha level of 0.025, as established from a previous study of
elamipretide in patients with PMM.11 The 2-sided alpha level
of 0.025 was used to account for a possible multiplicity ad-
justment for the primary efficacy endpoints.

Efficacy was assessed in the intention-to-treat (ITT) pop-
ulation, defined as all participants who received at least 1 dose
of investigational medication, and the per-protocol (PP)
population, which included all ITT participants without de-
fined protocol violations/deviations identified per blinded
data review before database lock. These protocol violations/
deviations included not meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria
or having a selected major protocol deviation deemed to
potentially affect efficacy findings; not completing the study;
not receiving investigational treatment within 2 days before
the week 24 visit; having <80% compliance to investigational
product; and not completing the study. Safety was assessed in
the safety population, defined as all participants who received
at least 1 dose of investigational medication.

Primary and secondary efficacy outcomes were assessed as the
change from baseline to each on-treatment time point with
the primary time point being end of treatment (week 24).
Analyses of continuous endpoints were conducted using a
mixed-model repeated measures approach, with fixed effects
for treatment, visit, the treatment-by-visit interaction, and
participant as a random effect. The baseline value and a
baseline-by-visit interaction for the endpoint were included as
covariates. A family-wise alpha level of 0.05 was maintained
for the primary endpoints, using Hochberg procedure at the
primary time point of 24 weeks. If both primary endpoints
were significantly different from placebo at the 0.05 (2-sided )
level of significance in favor of elamipretide, then both end-
points were considered statistically significant. If not, the
endpoint with the smaller p value of the 2 was considered
statistically significant if the p value was ≤0.025 (2-sided ).

Figure 1 Participant Disposition

Two hundred ninety-six participants were screened, and 218 participants were randomized to treatment. Two participants in the elamipretide group and 1
patient in the placebo grouphad the treatment withdrawn due to adverse event before study discontinuation. The ITT population included 109 participants in
the elamipretide group and 109participants in the placebo group. ThePP population included 102 participants in the elamipretide group and 103participants
in the placebo group. ITT = intention-to-treat; PP = per-protocol.

In the event that both endpoints in the primary endpoint
family were significant at the 5% level, then secondary end-
points were to be tested at week 24 with type I error control,
achieved by testing sequentially using a 2-sided alpha level of
0.05. The endpoints and hierarchy of comparisons were as
follows: (1) change from baseline in Neuro-QoL Fatigue
Short-Form (T score); (2) change from baseline in PGI of
PMM symptoms; (3) change from baseline in CGI of PMM
symptoms; and (4) change from baseline in most bothersome
symptom score on the PMMSA. Sequential comparisons to
control type I error were only to be completed if previous
comparisons were statistically significant. For these analyses,
p values were nominal.

Subgroup Analyses by PMM Genotype
Given the extensive genetic heterogeneity of the study pop-
ulation, an exploratory analysis of genetic subgroups by ge-
nomic alteration (mtDNA and nDNA) was performed using
the same methods as described for the primary efficacy end-
points earlier (ITT population using similar mixed-model
repeated measure [MMRM] models).

Because of a potential data entry error, which was later
identified in post hoc data analysis, 3 participants were mis-
classified in the clinical study report as having a pathogenic
mtDNA variant. Post hoc analyses revealed that these 3 par-
ticipants instead had nDNA alteration, either in POLG (2
participants) or TWNK (in 1 participant). Accordingly, these
participants were moved from the mtDNA group into the
nDNA cohort for the included genetic alteration analyses.
6MWT for 1 participant at week 24 was deemed unusable

because the participant inadvertently received walking assistance
and was therefore not included in the 6MWT analyses. Study
protocol and statistical analysis plan were published on Clin-
icalTrials.gov updated on January 24th 2022 (NCT03323749).32

Pharmacokinetic Analysis
The PK population included 106 participants randomized and
treated with elamipretide, with at least 1 PK sample taken
during their participation. PK modeling for elamipretide and
its metabolites, M1 and M2, were performed using NON-
MEM computer software. Covariates, such as age, genotype,
weight, height, lean body mass, body mass index, liver func-
tion tests, serum creatinine, and renal function (as described
by estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) were ana-
lyzed. The exposure-response analysis examined response
based on the 6MWT as a function of steady-state exposure to
elamipretide and its metabolites.

Results
Participants
Of the 296 participants screened for eligibility inMMPOWER-3,
218 were enrolled and randomized to treatment (elamipretide
n = 109; placebo n = 109) between October 2017 and De-
cember 2019 (Figure 1). Of those receiving investigational
product (n = 218), 205 (94%) completed the double-blind pe-
riod of the study, with a similar percentage of participants for
each treatment group completing (n = 102 [93.6%] elamipretide
and n = 103 [94.5%] placebo). Thirteen randomized partici-
pants (6.0%) discontinued treatment (main reason being par-
ticipant decision; n = 9 [4.1%]).Most of the participants (90.8%;
n = 198/218) were included in the PP patient population (n =
96 [88.1%] for elamipretide and n = 102 [93.6%] for placebo).

Participant demographics at baseline were similar between
treatment groups, and characteristics demonstrated similar
impairment in PMM (Table 1). Of the 218 treatment-
randomized participants, the mean age was 44.9 years with
participants mostly being White (94%; n = 203/218) and fe-
male (64.2% n = 140/218). The mean weight was 66.0 (±18.9)
kg, height was 165.7 (±10.4) cm, and BMI was 24.0 (±6.0) kg/
m2. Among the participants who completed the 6MWT at
baseline, the average distance walked was 330.28 (±76.5) me-
ters. One participant had a protocol violation of walking >450
meters on the 6MWT at baseline. The mean PMMSATFS was
10.6 (±2.5). The Neuro-QoL Fatigue Short-Form average T
score was 55.0 (±7.5) points. At screening, participants
reported tiredness during activities (28.9%; n = 63), muscle
weakness during activities, (21.1%; n = 46), balance problems
(11.5%; n = 25), and tiredness at rest (10.6%; n = 23) on the
PMMSA as the most bothersome symptoms of the 10 symp-
toms of PMM, with bothersome symptoms varying slightly
between treatment groups (Table 2).

Baseline genetic test results showed most of the participants
(74%, n = 162) had mtDNA alteration, with the remainder
(26%, n = 56) having nDNA defects (Table 3 and eFigure 1,
links.lww.com/WNL/C851). Because participants were
stratified by the subclassification of the genetic class, the
distribution of genetic class between mtDNA and nDNA was
similar between treatment groups. Three participants were
misclassified in the clinical study report (identified in a post
hoc analysis) as having a pathogenic mtDNA variant. Instead,
these 3 participants had nDNA alteration (either in POLG [2
participants] orTWNK [in 1 participant]). Accordingly, these
participants were moved from the mtDNA group into the
nDNA cohort for the genetic alteration analyses, resulting in
73% (n = 159) withmtDNA alteration and the remaining 27%
(n = 59) with nDNA defects.

distance walked at week 24 was 14.1 (±5.7) meters for par-
ticipants receiving elamipretide and 17.3 (±5.7) meters for
participants receiving placebo, a −3.2-meter difference be-
tween the 2 groups (95% CI −18.7 to 12.3; p = 0.69)
(Figure 2A). The per-protocol (PP) participant analysis
demonstrated a −2.2-meter difference between the 2 groups
(95% CI −16.9 to 12.5; p = 0.77).

Elamipretide-treated participants reported more total fatigue at
baseline and less total fatigue at end of treatment, as assessed by
the PMMSA TFS. The LS mean (SE) of change from baseline
to week 24 on the PMMSA TFS was −1.13 (±0.22) for par-
ticipants receiving elamipretide and −1.05 (±0.22) for partici-
pants receiving placebo, a −0.07 difference between the 2
groups (95% CI −0.69 to 0.54; p = 0.81) (Figure 2B). The PP
participant analysis demonstrated a 0.09 difference between the

Analyses by Genetic Subgroup: mtDNA vs nDNA
mtDNA: Subgroup analysis for participants with mtDNA
alteration of the 6MWT at the end of treatment showed the
LS mean (SE) of change from baseline in distance walked at
week 24 was 14.0 (±6.1) meters for participants receiving
elamipretide (n = 74) and 25.0 (±6.1) meters for participants
receiving placebo (n = 79), an −11.0-meter between-group
difference favoring placebo (95% CI −28.1 to 6.1; p = 0.21;
Figure 3A).

nDNA: For participants with nDNA alteration (post hoc
analysis), the LS mean (SE) change from baseline in distance
walked at week 24 was 25.5 (±8.0) meters for participants
receiving elamipretide (n = 29) and 0.3 (±7.7) meters for
participants receiving placebo (n = 29), a 25.2-meter differ-
ence between the 2 groups favoring elamipretide (95% CI
3.1–47.3; p = 0.03; Figure 3B).

For participants with mtDNA alteration, the LS mean (SE) of
change from baseline at week 24 on the PMMSA TFS was
−1.3 (±0.2424) for participants receiving elamipretide and
−1.1 (±0.2525) for participants receiving placebo, a −0.21
difference between the 2 groups (95% CI −0.9 to 0.5; p =
0.55). For participants with nDNA alteration (post hoc
analysis), LS mean (SE) of change from baseline at week 24
was −0.45 (±0.25) for participants receiving elamipretide and
−0.48 (±0.24) for participants receiving placebo, a 0.03 dif-
ference between the groups (p = 0.93).

Safety
In total, 109 participants received elamipretide and 109 re-
ceived placebo. AEs during the treatment period were
reported by a higher percentage of elamipretide-treated par-
ticipants (98.2% [n = 107/109]) than placebo-treated par-
ticipants (76.1% [n = 83/109]) (Table 4). Most AEs in the
elamipretide group (97.2%) and half of AEs in the placebo
group (51.4%) were reported as treatment-related AEs. Most
of the AEs were mild or moderate in intensity. The most
commonly reported AEs for participants receiving elamipre-
tide (frequency >10%) were injection site reactions (see
Table 4). Injection site reactions experienced with elamipre-
tide included erythema, pruritus, pain, swelling, induration,
bruising, hemorrhage, urticaria, and injection site nodules and
masses. A low percentage of serious adverse events (SAEs)
were reported for participants in the elamipretide (n = 5/109
[4.6%]) and the placebo groups (n = 3/109 [2.8%]) and were
not deemed to be treatment related. The incidence of AEs
leading to discontinuation was greater in the elamipretide
group (n = 8/109 [7.3%] and n = 2/109 [1.8%] for placebo,
respectively). No participants had an AE with an outcome of
death or hospitalization.

Pharmacokinetics
Population pharmacokinetic models were fit successfully to 3
analytes, elamipretide and 2 metabolites, M1 and M2. For
elamipretide, systemic parameters scaled allometrically. No
covariates influenced the systemic or absorption parameters.
For M1 and M2, apparent clearance decreased with age and
increased with renal function. No other covariates influenced

the systemic parameters. In the exposure-response analysis,
participants with an nDNA alteration had an increase in the
change and fractional change at week 24 compared with that
at day 1 (i.e., baseline) value for the 6MWT as a function of
the elamipretide steady state area under the curve (p = 0.0262
and p = 0.0345, respectively).

Discussion
We present the results of the first phase 3 trial in PMM with
elamipretide. Overall, participants who received elamipretide
did not meet either primary or secondary endpoints. Specif-
ically, there were no statistically significant changes between
elamipretide and placebo in the 6MWT or the PMMSA Total
Fatigue Score. MMPOWER-3 uncovered several findings,
specifically the importance of considering pathogenic geno-
types within the PMM population when evaluating the effect
of investigational treatments. Among the most interesting
findings of the trial, identified in a post hoc analysis, was that
participants with PMM with nDNA defects performed sig-
nificantly better on the 6MWT, whereas participants with
mtDNA alteration did not differ from placebo. The insight

from these subgroups are novel findings and are expected to
contribute substantially to future PMM studies.

Patient improvements in 6MWT and PMMSA TFS from this
study showed a similar trend as those results obtained from
the phase 1/2 (MMPOWER-1) and phase 2 (MMPOWER-
2) clinical trials of elamipretide in patients with PMM.10,11

MMPOWER-110 informed the dose selection for the phase 2
and 3 studies, while the results from the phase 2 study,
MMPOWER-2,11 provided an efficacy signal and data to
support the initiation of this phase 3 study.

While this study did not meet either of its primary endpoints
(changes in the 6MWT and PMMSA Total Fatigue Score),
participants treated with elamipretide did report slightly less
total fatigue (between-group difference was not statistically
significant) at the end of treatment, as assessed by the
PMMSA Total Fatigue Score. Future studies are needed to
elucidate whether the slight change in PMMSA Total fatigue
score in treated and untreated participants is within the test
variability range or a true measure of fatigue improvement not
reaching statistical significance due to the mild-to-moderate

impairment of participants at baseline and increased hetero-
geneity in participant selection.

The response in 6MWT in the nDNA cohort, as a function
of plasma area under the curve (AUC0-24), demonstrates a
statistically significant correlation, which supports this sub-
group finding, and suggests that the therapeutic dose may
not be optimized. It is possible that the exposure-response
relationship may differ by genotype/phenotype. These
findings warrant further investigation and clearly underscore
the importance of considering genetic subtypes in mito-
chondrial myopathy and the drug mechanism of action. All

the genes responsible for mtDNA maintenance are
expressed in the nuclear genome.33 Mitochondrial proteins/
enzymes that are synthesized from nDNA must be trans-
ported across the inner mitochondrial membrane, enriched
with cardiolipin.34 These metabolite and nucleotide trans-
porters depend on cardiolipin for their assembly and
activity,35,36 and cardiolipin is known to stabilize mtDNA
packaging into nucleoids.37 It is intriguing to speculate that
elamipretide’s benefit in the nDNA cohort was caused by
improved enzyme/metabolite transport into mitochon-
dria, improved assembly and morphology of mitochondria,
augmented mtDNA stability, reductions in ROS, or any

combination thereof. Although these presumptions are sup-
ported by preclinical work where elamipretide improved mito-
chondrial protein import and mitochondrial morphology,13,27,38

further investigation will advance our understanding of the
6MWT increase in the nDNA cohort.

Although the patient population with PMM included in the
MMPOWER-3 study was impaired on the 6MWT at baseline
compared with literature-based healthy controls (655 [±91]
meters),33 the phase 3 population was only moderately im-
paired based on the average PMMSA fatigue score and only
slightly more impaired than the population norm on the
Neuro-QoL Fatigue Short-Form T score (mean T score ≥50
points at baseline). In these mildly to moderately impaired
participants, elamipretide did not demonstrate statistically
significant changes on the primary endpoints (6MWT and
PMMSA TFS) from baseline to 24 weeks compared with
placebo. Additional analyses involving functional and patient
reported outcomes are necessary to assess the ability of ela-
mipretide to affect positive changes in genetically defined
subgroups of this patient population.

In this phase-3 study, elamipretide was generally well toler-
ated. Most AEs were mild to moderate in severity, with the
most commonly reported AEs including injection site reac-
tions. This safety was similar to that observed in the
MMPOWER-2 study11 and the TAZPOWER study in pa-
tients with Barth syndrome with no serious AEs or deaths.12

There are important lessons to be learned from this clinical
trial regarding trial design in PMD. The first is that a better
understanding of the natural history of PMM will help in
future studies. Although the RePOWER pretrial, non-
interventional registry30 did not facilitate the ability to study
effort-dependent endpoints, it did enhance the understanding
of disease mechanisms and derisk/homogenize disease group
selection for trial participants according to the specific drug-
intended targets but not the effort-dependent endpoints.

The second lesson is that there is a clear need to further study
meaningful endpoints in this patient population. Fatigue has
been identified as the primary issue which this patient pop-
ulation experiences, identifying a definitive focal point to be
addressed in future therapeutic trials. Refining the sensitivity of
the PMMSA fatigue scores in PMD and PMM further to cap-
ture signals is tantamount for future studies to address data gaps.

The lack of available biomarkers for PMM also presented
challenges. The variability of participant responses to the
PMMSATotal Fatigue score, which is susceptible to a placebo
effect were all challenges that skewed the objectivity of the
study endpoints. Furthermore, the mild-to-moderate fatigue
scores observed at baseline point to a lack of sensitivity of this
endpoint. The identification of objective endpoints or bio-
markers assessing PMM would be beneficial for future trial
design because the availability of biomarkers helps to target
individuals who are most likely to respond to treatment,
providing the ability to verify target engagement, which could
allow the use of enrichment strategies and reduce reliance on
effort-dependent endpoints. For example, altered plasma
acylcarnitine levels have previously been seen in patients with
PMM,39 and elamipretide has been shown to reduce plasma
acylcarnitines in other PMD,40 but the relation of this

biomarker to clinically meaningful changes in daily life needs
to be established.

The third lesson is from the basket design fromMMPOWER-
3, which pooled both nDNA and mtDNA participants. The
placebo effect on 6MWT was prominent in mtDNA partici-
pants in the prespecified subgroup analysis, and given the size
of this subgroup, this drove the placebo effect observed in the
trial. Conversely, there was not a discernible placebo response
on 6MWT in nDNA participants (depicted in Figure 3B), as
identified in a post hoc analysis. Based on these observations,
it seems that the MMPOWER-3 basket trial design in-
troduced insurmountable heterogeneity. It has been shown
that substantial efficiencies are possible in basket trial design
only if the investigational drug works in most or all baskets in
the clinical study, with losses of power and statistical signifi-
cance if the investigational drug only works in a single bas-
ket.41 The basket trial design used in MMPOWER-3
introduced significant heterogeneity between participants
with mtDNA and nDNA alteration, which was particularly
apparent with 6MWT results seen in the prespecified sub-
group analysis by genetic abnormality. Therefore, it is
doubtful that a separation in efficacy between active treatment
and placebo would have been observed regardless of the
length of the trial. This critical lesson advances our un-
derstanding of the various PMM genotypes and highlights the
need to critically consider particular genotypes in the design
of future trials.

The MMPOWER clinical development program was the
most advanced and complete in PMM and provided signifi-
cant lessons regarding study design and patient enrollment
parameters. MMPOWER-3 was the first trial that progressed
into phase 3 to assess a therapy for participants with PMM.
Although the primary endpoints were not met for the overall
population, the observation of the improvement in the
6MWT in the nDNA subgroup is encouraging and hypothesis
generating. Efforts are currently underway to confirm this
positive benefit and these findings in a follow-up and targeted
phase 3 trial in participants with PMM with pathogenic
nDNA variants.
