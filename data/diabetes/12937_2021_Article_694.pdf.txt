Abstract

Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is much more frequent and more severe, including cirrhosis,
hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with type 2 diabetes. Coffee is a complex beverage with hundreds of
compounds whereas caffeine and chlorogenic acid are the most abundant bioactive compounds. The published
epidemiological data demonstrating beneficial associations between all categories of coffee exposure and ranges of
liver outcomes are rapidly growing; however, the main contributors and cause-effect relationships have not yet
been elucidated. To address existing knowledge gaps, we sought to determine the efficacy and safety of 6 months
chlorogenic acid and/or caffeine supplementation in patients with type 2 diabetes affected by NAFLD.

Methods: This trial was carried out at two Diabetes Centers to assess the effects of supplementation with daily
doses of 200 mg chlorogenic acid, 200 mg caffeine, 200 mg chlorogenic acid plus 200 mg caffeine or placebo
(starch) in patients with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD. The primary endpoint was reduction of hepatic fat and
stiffness measured by FibroScan, and changes in serum hepatic enzymes and cytokeratin − 18 (CK-18) levels.
Secondary endpoints were improvements in metabolic (including fasting glucose, homeostasis model assessment-
estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), hemoglobin A1c (HBA1C), C-peptide, insulin and lipid profiles) and
inflammatory (including nuclear factor k-B (NF-KB), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), high sensitive- C reactive
protein(hs-CRP)) parameters from baseline to the end of treatment.

Results: Neither chlorogenic acid nor caffeine was superior to placebo in attenuation of the hepatic fat and
stiffness and other hepatic outcomes in patients with diabetes and NAFLD. Except for the lower level of total
cholesterol in caffeine group (p = 0.04), and higher level of insulin in chlorogenic acid plus caffeine group (p = 0.01)
compared with placebo, there were no significant differences among the treatment groups.

Conclusion: These findings do not recommend caffeine and/or chlorogenic acid to treat NAFLD in type 2 diabetes
patients.

Introduction
Patients with type 2 diabetes have a risk of developing
serious liver related complications including non-
alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hepatic cirrhosis,
and hepatocellular carcinoma that is two to four times
higher than those without diabetes [1].
Observational studies in different populations have

suggested that coffee consumption is associated with a
reduced risk of NAFLD [2, 3], liver fibrosis [4], type 2
diabetes [5], and hepatocellular carcinoma [6]. It is well
established that coffee is a mixture of various chemical
compounds; among the identified constituents, caffeine,
chlorogenic acids, and two diterpenes (cafestol and kah-
weol) are the main compounds [7]. Caffeine is thought
to prevent or reverse hepatic fibrosis by several mecha-
nisms including acting as an A2A receptor antagonist
which affect the activation of hepatic stellate cells [8].
Recent meta -analysis suggests that this association may
be explained by caffeine and not by the decaffeinated
coffee. Caffeine is thought to inhibit the proliferation of
hepatocellular carcinoma cell [9]. Data from the Na-
tional Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys
(NHANES) that collected between 2001 and 2008 indi-
cated caffeine intake as one of the five independent pre-
dictors of NAFLD, suggesting that caffeine may have a
potential protective effect [10]. However, a meta- ana-
lysis has shown that regular coffee caffeine consumption,
but not total caffeine intake, is associated with a lower
levels of fibrosis severity [7]. This finding might suggest
other ingredients in regular coffee, rather than caffeine,
could be responsible for its antifibrotic effects [11].
Chlorogenic acid (a major polyphenol in coffee) plays an
important role on modulating glucose intolerance and
hyperlipidemia [12], might also play an important role in
hepatoprotection. Diterpenes are found in coffee as es-
ters of fatty acid and are known to have a cholesterol
raising properties [13]. It is remained unknown what
bioactive component in coffee contributes its part more
significantly for the reported effects [14].
Although recent meta-analysis of observational studies

have shown the beneficial association of coffee

consumption with risk reduction of NAFLD and liver
fibrosis [15], observational studies can only show associ-
ation, but cannot provide evidence of causal relationship.
The relationship between coffee consumption and liver fi-
brosis might be due to other factors in frequent coffee
drinkers behavior. The hepatoprotective benefits of coffee
have not been studied in randomized controlled trials. So,
it could not be included in evidence based treatment rec-
ommendations. Thus, clinical trials are necessary to find a
possible cause-effect relationship, while finding the main
effective components of coffee, and their mechanism of
action. Therefore, we performed this randomized clinical
trial to assess the efficacy and safety of two main compo-
nents of coffee including caffeine and/or chlorogenic acid
at a dose of 200mg daily in patients who had type 2
diabetes accompanied with NAFLD.

Methods
Enrollment occurred at two clinics of diabetes in Endo-
crinology and Metabolism Research Center (Tehran
University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran), from
September 29, 2017 through March 19, 2018 and the
final date of follow up was October 10, 2018. The proto-
col (available at nimad.ac.ir) was approved by the Na-
tional Institute for Medical Research Developments
Ethics Committee (IR.NIMAD.REC.1396.028), and all
participants provided written informed consent.
Capsules containing the caffeine and/ or chlorogenic
acid and matching placeboes were provided by Arjuna
Natural Extracts, India.

Study population
Men and women aged 30–53 years with type 2 diabetes
(based on 1999 World Health Organization (WHO) cri-
teria) and NAFLD (controlled attenuation parameter
(CAP) score of 260 or more) were eligible for enroll-
ment. Exclusion criteria were current use of insulin,
current pregnancy or breastfeeding, alcohol intake as de-
fined by an average daily consumption of alcohol > 20 g/
day within the previous year, evidence of other forms of
liver diseases (such as viral hepatitis, autoimmune

hepatitis, etc.), evidence of cirrhosis (according to transi-
ent elastography (TE) exam and biochemical profile),
current supplementation with vitamin E and other anti-
oxidants, treatment with Milk thistle (Silybummaria-
num) (to reduce the effects of confounding factors
related to treatment strategies) in the past 6 month or
during the study, a history of thyroid, kidney, and mental
disease, heart failure, and cancer. Subjects were asked to
bring their current medications at the time of screening,
and they were checked by the investigator.

Study procedures
We identified potential patients treated with stable dose
of oral anti-hyperglycemic agents and recruited them to
fill out a screening questionnaire. Those who answered
the questionnaire indicating that they are willing and eli-
gible to participate in the trial, entered in the diagnosis
for NAFLD phase, during which, we invited them to
undergo abdominal ultrasonography. Patients who had
hepatic steatosis of grade 2 or more were examined by
TE. Patients who remained eligible (a CAP score level of
at least 260 dB/m but Liver stiffness measurements
(LSM) levels less than 14 kPa) were randomly assigned
by a double-blind fashion using random blocked
randomization in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive 2 capsules
containing either 200 mg of chlorogenic acid plus 200
mg of caffeine (about 2 cups of coffee), or 200 mg caf-
feine plus placebo (starch), or 200 mg chlorogenic acid
plus placebo, or two matching placebo capsules daily for
6 months. All of investigators involved in this study were
blinded to the treatments groups until final analysis.
Study visits were conducted at baseline and at 6, 12, 18,
24 weeks after initiation of the trial. At each visit, infor-
mation was gathered regarding adverse events and ad-
herence to study. At the baseline and after 24 weeks of
follow up, we collected blood samples, along with an-
thropometric, blood pressure, and non-invasive markers
of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis measurements.

Outcomes
LSM expressed in kilopascals (kPa) and CAP score
expressed in dB/m were assessed using FibroScan (Echo-
Sense, Paris, France) in participants fasted for at least 3 h
according to the manufacturer’s guideline.
Nutritionist IV software (First Data Bank, The Hearst

Corporation, San Bruno, CA) was used for the analysis
of 24 h dietary recalls (5 weekdays and 2 weekend). In
addition, physical activity was estimated using the inter-
national physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ) by multi-
plying MET (Metabolic Equivalent of Task) and time
spent in each activity [16]. To assess potential changes
in daily food consumption and physical activity during
the 6-month intervention, participants kept a 7-day food
record and a record of their physical activity at baseline

and at month 6 of the intervention. All participants were
asked to maintain their usual dietary intake and habitual
physical activity for the duration of trial.
Resting energy expenditure was measured after 12 h

fasting, using Fitmate Calorimeter (Cosmed, Rome,
Italy), while the patients were lied down. Body compos-
ition was assessed using body impedance analyzer (BIA)
(Tanita, Ilinois, USA).
Blood samplings were performed early in the morning

after an overnight fast of 10-12 h. The blood collection
from participants, blood withdrawal and blood analyses
were done by trained and experienced laboratory techni-
cians in laboratory of Endocrinology and Metabolism
Research Institute under suitable conditions. Serum liver
enzymes (alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate trans-
aminase (AST), and gamma-glutamyl transferase
(GGT)), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (HDL), triglycerides (TG), creatinine (Cr)
and high sensitive- C reactive protein (hs-CRP) mea-
sured by using ELISA kit (Roche, Germany). Low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) values were calcu-
lated using the Friedewald formula. Hemoglobin A1c
(HbA1c) levels were assessed by a high performance li-
quid chromatography analyzer (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan).
Fasting blood glucose levels were measured using the
glucose oxidase method on an auto analyzer (Cobas c
311, Roche Dignostics, Risch-Rotkreuz, Switzerland).
Serum insulin, C-peptide and thyroid stimulating hor-
mone (TSH) levels were measured by using ELISA kit
(Monobind Inc. Lake Forest, California, USA). Homeo-
stasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance
(HOMA-IR) score was used to determine the degree of
insulin resistance using the following formula: HOMA-
IR = Fasting insulin (μU/mL) × Fasting glucose (mmol/
L)/22.5. Serum concentrations of total antioxidant cap-
acity (TAC), adiponectin, and cytokeratin-18 (CK-18)
were measured using ELISA method (ZellBio GmbH,
Ulm, Germany). Serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α
was measured by ELISA (Diaclone, France). Nuclear fac-
tor k-B (NF-kB) levels was assessed in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) nuclear extracts using an
ELISA kit (ZellBio GmbH, Ulm, Germany) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.

Statistical analysis
The sample size was calculated for the CAP score, which
was based on detection of a 10 unit (dB/m) difference in
the mean CAP score with a power of 80% (β = 20%),
yielding a sample size of 21 for each group. Given the
probability of samples loss, twenty five patients in each
group were considered [17].
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS ver-

sion 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) on an intention-
to-treat basis. Quantitative variables are presented as the

mean ± SD. One-way ANOVA were used to examine the
consistency of study groups. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov
test was used to determine normality of distribution of
the examined variables. Non-normally distributed vari-
ables were log transformed. Repeated-measures of
ANOVA were used after intervention for assessment of
differences between the treatment groups with adjusting
for baseline insulin and the baseline value of the out-
come being analyzed. Tukey significance difference test
was used for post hoc multiple comparisons. Enumer-
ation data were analyzed by the Chi-squared test. Two-
tailed P < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results
From September 2017 through March 2018, a total of
101 patients underwent randomization to receive pla-
cebo (n = 23), caffeine plus chlorogenic acid (n = 27),
chlorogenic acid alone (n = 25), or caffeine alone (n =
26); however, we excluded one patient from caffeine

alone group who had a diagnosis of prediabetes. Totally,
a hundred participants comprised the intention- to- treat
population, of whom 84 (84%) completed the study
(Fig. 1). There were no meaningful imbalance in demo-
graphic characteristics or use of ongoing medications
(Table 1), or dietary intake (Table 2), clinical and labora-
tory data with the exception of insulin levels (p = 0.009)
(data not shown). The mean age of all patients was
44.57 ± 5.65 years, with a mean diabetes duration of
4.57 ± 4.23 years and the majority of them were male
(68%). There was no significant difference in dietary in-
takes among the groups before and after the
intervention.
Table 3 shows the differences in hepatic indicators,

metabolic profile, inflammatory and total antioxidant
levels among treatment groups at the end of study ad-
justed for the baseline values and insulin levels. CAP
scores and LSM were not significantly different among
the groups. Similarly, no significant differences between

groups were evident in other hepatic indicators includ-
ing AST, ALT, GGT, Ck-18 levels (p > 0.05). Except for
increase in fasting insulin (mean differences 3.3 μIU/ml
[95%CI, − 1.3 to 6.7]; p = 0.01), in chlorogenic acid plus
caffeine compared with placebo, none of the other sup-
plementations were significantly associated with changes
in fasting glucose, HOMA-IR, HBA1C or C-peptide
compared with placebo. Supplementation with caffeine
significantly decreased cholesterol levels as compared
with placebo (mean differences − 20.66 mg/dl [95%CI, −
40.55 to − 0.78]; p = 0.04), whereas LDL- cholesterol,
HDL- cholesterol, and TG were not affected by any
other groups of treatments. No other significant differ-
ences among the four groups were found in those
treated with caffeine or/ and chlorogenic acid compared
with placebo regarding all other biomarkers (NF-KB,

TNF-α, hs-CRP, TAC, adiponectin, Cr and TSH). More-
over, systolic and diastolic blood pressure changes did
not differ significantly among the groups. No side effects
were reported during the study period.

Discussion
This is the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trial of chlorogenic acid and/ or caffeine sup-
plementation performed in type 2 diabetes patients with
NAFLD. This trial showed that an intervention based on
main components of coffee has no significant effect on
hepatic fat content and fibrosis in type 2 diabetic pa-
tients affected by NAFLD. Six months supplementation
with caffeine and/or chlorogenic acid did not improve
either hepatic enzymes (ALT, AST, and GGT) or the
serum levels of CK-18 as a specific biomarker for liver

injury. As we specifically aimed to investigate the effects
of coffee main constitutes on NAFLD in patients with
diabetes, we also tested the hypothesis of an involvement
of chlorogenic acid and/ or caffeine in modulating insu-
lin resistance (HOMA-IR), metabolic and glycemic con-
trol (fasting glucose, HBA1C) in these subjects. Our
results have shown that except for increase in insulin in
chlorogenic acid plus caffeine group, and decrease in
cholesterol in caffeine group, none of these parameters
significantly changed after 6 months intervention in
comparison with the placebo group. Likewise, the sup-
plementation did not induce any specific effect on thy-
roid and renal function as measured by TSH and Cr
levels, respectively. Similarly, neither inflammatory in-
dictors nor antioxidant capacity changes were signifi-
cantly different between active treated groups and
placebo after 6 months.
Decaffeinated and regular coffee consumption have

been investigated in prevention and treatment of NAFL
D with varying results in many large observational stud-
ies; most of which reported that coffee has beneficial im-
pact on liver; however rarely, it was the main target of
interest or studied in clinical trials [3, 18]. In pre -clin-
ical studies, caffeine seems to be able to exert inhibitory
effects on fibrogenesis and block the progression of liver
steatosis through interruption in transforming growth
factor-β (TGF-β) signaling, inhibition of stellate cells
and by its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties
[19]. However, contrary to these hypotheses, we ob-
served that caffeine and / or chlorogenic acid did not
significantly affect liver outcomes after 6 months supple-
mentation. Coffee contains other substances (e.g. mela-
noidins, niacin, diterphenoic alcohols) in addition to
caffeine and chlorogenic acid that could exert a protect-
ive effect on a range of liver diseases [18, 20]. In the
present study, the amount of caffeine or chlorogenic acid
ingested by the subjects was 200mg/day, which equates
to the amount of caffeine found in 2 cups of coffee,
which might not be enough to show any effect. Observa-
tional studies showed that drinking more than 3 cups
coffee per day is protective against fatty liver [18, 21].
Since increase in blood pressure with regular coffee or
caffeine intake have been observed [22], we were not en-
sured that most of our patients would easily tolerate
upper doses of coffee (above 200 mg/d). However, this
study did not provide support for the adverse relation-
ship between coffee and blood pressure and even led to
non-significant 1.2–1.69 mmHg decrease in diastolic
blood pressure. A meta- analysis of clinical trials and
prospective cohort studies’ results are in consistent with
our study, suggesting no evidence of any relationship be-
tween coffee consumption and hypertension [23]. Zhang
et al. described an inverse J-shaped association between
intake of this beverage and hypertension risk; so that

one to three cups coffee/day intake compared with less
than one cup/day could increase the risk, while protect-
ive effects were observed at higher intakes [24]. Another
meta-analyses concluded a beneficial effect of coffee on
blood pressure [25, 26]. It is important to note that sex,
race, and lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking) have been con-
sidered as factors involved in the different shape of rela-
tionship between coffee use and blood pressure [22]. In
addition, inter -individual differences mainly due to the
variation in caffeine metabolism related genes including
CYP1A2 (slow caffeine metabolizers vs. rapid metaboli-
zers) may partially explain conflicting results [24]. As we
aimed specifically to assess the efficacy of chlorogenic
acid and/ or caffeine supplementation on liver steatosis
in type 2 diabetes patients, our sample consisted of pa-
tients attending to our diabetes outpatients’ center for
routine diabetes care. So, this setting led to recruitment
of cases with mild degree of NAFLD rather than those
with advanced liver disease referring to hepatology
clinics. The results from Bambha et al. study showed
that in those with less insulin resistance, high coffee
consumption was inversely associated with advanced fi-
brosis, as compared with those with greater insulin re-
sistance. So, it could speculate less benefit of coffee
consumption on liver fibrosis treatment in patients with
diabetes who have insulin resistance [14]. Indeed, we
cannot rule out the effect of coffee components in
NAFLD patients with greater fibrosis or patients with
less insulin resistance or non-diabetic patients. The lack
of significant effects of coffee on liver outcomes are con-
sistent with the non-significant effects of coffee on anti-
oxidant and inflammatory and anti-inflammatory
biomarkers. Similar to the results from previous trials,
we did not find any effects of coffee on hs-CRP [27, 28],
and TNF-α [29]. In this study, no change in NF-KB ac-
tivity in PBMCs was also observed. The lack of antioxi-
dant and anti-inflammatory responses in the present
study could partly mediate the non-significant effect of
supplements on liver after caffeine and / or chlorogenic
acid ingestion. Although few studies in the past have
attempted to assess the effect of caffeine on inflamma-
tory biomarkers, the findings remained unclear mainly
as a result of different study designs and outcomes [30].
A recent systematic review has concluded that coffee con-
sumption was either neutrally or inversely associated with
serum concentrations of inflammatory markers [30].
In a meta-analysis on cross sectional studies between

2008 and 2017, Zhang et al. showed that coffee con-
sumption is efficient to increase adiponectin levels only
in females [31]. This finding could be explained by the
difference in number of fat cells between men and
women [31]. In addition, intake of 4 ≤ cups of coffee in
women with and without diabetes was also associated
with 20% increase in adiponectin levels [32]. In contrast,

Mansour et al. Nutrition Journal           (2021) 20:35 Page 7 of 11



Wedick et al. found increase in adiponectin levels in
both genders after 8 weeks of supplementation with 5
cups of coffee/d [27]. However, in a cross sectional study
on multi-ethnic Asian population, there was no relation-
ship between coffee drinking and adiponectin concentra-
tion [33]. Our data are corroborated by the finding of
this study which did not observe differences in levels of
adiponectin even after including both genders. Green
coffee bean extract supplementation in NAFLD patients
induced significant increase in TAC and decrease in hs-
CRP, but not in TNF- α [34]. Consistent with these re-
sults, a study of healthy adults who drank coffee which
contained medium and high chlorogenic acid reported
positive change in antioxidant capacity [35]. Our finding,
however, indicate that chlorogenic acid has no major ef-
fect on antioxidant capacity in diabetic patients.
Evidence concerning the effect of regular and decaf-

feinated coffee on insulin sensitivity is controversial, es-
pecially as data provided by short term trials and
observational studies have reached discordant results
and conclusions [12]. Since 2002, many but not all ob-
servational studies have found potential beneficial effect
of both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee consump-
tion against the incidence of developing type 2 diabetes
by 30–60% in a diverse population [12, 36]. In addition,
previous experimental studies have shown that chloro-
genic acid is responsible for hypoglycemic effects of cof-
fee. This result can be explained by inhibition of glucose
absorption and at the cellular level, activating AMP-
activated protein kinase (AMPK) [12]. However, the ob-
servational and experimental studies are not confirmed
by all human short term clinical trials [37, 38].
No significant effect was found on glucose metabolism

in our study, similar to previous report that evaluated
the effect of coffee on this variable in type 2 diabetes
[28]. We showed that chlorogenic acid may act synergis-
tically with caffeine to increase insulin levels. This find-
ing is consistent with a short term trial of healthy
volunteers in which caffeine administrated in capsulated
form (400mg in two capsules or 870 mg in six capsules)
or coffee drink (52 g coffee grounds) or roasted coffee
(300 ml) [37–39]. From the result of a recent meta -ana-
lysis conducted in healthy subjects, it has been found
that acute caffeine ingestion reduces insulin sensitivity
[40]. However, Da Silva et al. suggested that caffeine
consumption is associated with increase in insulin clear-
ance [41]. The mechanism of action could be explained
by the effects of caffein on increasing epinephrine re-
lease and free fatty acids levels or activation of adenosine
receptor [27, 38]. However, tolerance to some effects of
caffeine may be developed over time [27]. Moreover, caf-
feine stimulates insulin secretion primarily by activation
of ryanodine receptors in pancreatic β-cells in a glucose
dose dependent manner, with no effect at low glucose

concentrations and stimulating insulin only when glu-
cose concentration is high [42]. This mechanism may
explain why caffeine has increased insulin levels in dia-
betic patients in our long term study.
The association between coffee consumption and

serum lipids have been studied extensively, however,
yielded inconsistent results [28]. A meta- analysis of
clinical trials suggested possible increased serum levels
of LDL-C and total cholesterol for unfiltered coffee con-
sumption [43], but this finding was partially driven by
the results of English language literature and two im-
portant trials [44, 45], while studies published before
1998 were not identified. Additional data from a meta-
analysis including only randomized controlled trials in-
volving a total of 1017 subjects provided more informa-
tion about any potential effects of coffee consumption; it
suggested that the serum levels of TC, LDL-C and TG
may significantly increase by coffee consumption, but
the effect was greater for boiled (unfiltered) coffee [46].
Although studies that used filtered coffee (removed the
most of the oils by paper filter) have reported conflicting
results, some studies found positive effects (decrease in
cholesterol and LDL-C levels [47] and increase in HDL-
C) [28], while other studies did not find any effects of
coffee consumption on components of the lipid profile
[48]. The preparation method of coffee can affect the
concentrations of lipid altering factors such as cafestol
and kahweol and caffeine [49]; however, the effects of
caffeine on serum cholesterol remained unclear [46]. In
one observational study, investigators have suggested
that coffee consumption in a dose -dependent manner is
associated with lipid-raising effect, regardless of its caf-
feine content [50].
Although a case-control study found an unfavorable

association between caffeine consumption and choles-
terol [51], one of the finding of present study was
that caffeine intake (200 mg/ d) was associated with
about 20 mg/ dl decrease in total cholesterol over 6
months of follow up after adjustment for potential
confounders. Increase of fecal lipid extraction has
been suggested as a possible mechanism underling
the cholesterol –decreasing effect of caffeine [52]. In
addition, in observational studies, many people do not
consume coffee in isolation, but add sugar (glucose
and fructose) and milk which might be responsible
for increase in cholesterol levels [46].
To summarize, we did not meet the primary endpoint

of showing a reduction in hepatic fat and fibrosis in
NAFLD patients undergoing 6 months supplementation.
Indeed, it is possible to speculate that either the period
of exposure was not enough for modifying the hepatic
fat and fibrosis and the biochemical indicators of hepatic
involvement in NAFLD, or the link between coffee and
NAFLD could be appreciated only in specific

subpopulation of NAFLD patients. As we enrolled dia-
betic patients with the number of patients with few pa-
tients with advanced fibrosis, the results cannot be
generalized to other population and would be different if
non diabetic patients or NASH patients with advanced
fibrosis were included in the study. Furthermore, we
used the dose of 200mg of each supplement, while some
observational studies indicate that higher doses might be
effective.
This study has several advantages. This is the first

randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical
trial that evaluated the effects of main components of
coffee on patients with NAFLD and diabetes. Using
the extracted components of coffee provided us an
opportunity to roll out the confounding effects of cof-
fee preparation methods, varieties in different coffee
components, and variation in the amount of coffee
consumption. Since our study population had a back-
ground of lower caffeine consumption (i.e. irregular
coffee intake or coffee abstinence), this might resulted
in more accurate findings on the studied parameters,
as a tolerance to the effects of caffeine probably
would not have already developed. Furthermore, we
asked the patients to take supplements in the morn-
ing, which is usual mode of coffee intake. Further-
more, we combined chlorogenic acid and caffeine to
determine if there could be increased benefit from ad-
juvant therapy. In addition, because all participants
were newly diagnosed by NAFLD, they were not
undertaken any treatment as a part of clinical care,
which reduced the effects of confounding factors re-
lated to treatment strategies.

Conclusion
Our study found that six months supplementation with
200 mg/day of two main components of coffee had no
significant impact on non-invasive markers of hepatic
steatosis and fibrosis, liver biochemistry, inflammatory
and metabolic parameters in patients with NAFLD and
type 2 diabetes; however, this dosage was completely safe
without any reported side-effects. Further trials with
higher dosages, longer duration, and different active
components of coffee are highly recommended.
