Abstract
Objective: This study investigated the effects of aerobic exercise combined with re-
sistance	 training	on	serum	 inflammatory	 factors	and	heart	 rate	variability	 (HRV)	 in	
women	with	type	2	diabetes	mellitus	(T2DM).
Methods: A	total	of	30	patients	with	diabetic	cardiovascular	autonomic	neuropathy	
(DCAN)	were	randomly	divided	into	a	control	group	(n =	15)	and	an	exercise	group	
(n =	15).	The	control	group	was	treated	with	routine	hypoglycemic	drugs,	while	the	
exercise group was treated with routine hypoglycemic drugs + resistance train-
ing	 (AE + RT).	The	 levels	of	 fasting	plasma	glucose	 (FBG),	 two-	hour	plasma	glucose	
(2hPG),	serum	inflammatory	factors	C-	reactive	protein	(CRP),	interleukin-	6	(IL-	6)	and	
tumor	necrosis	factor	alpha	(TNF-	α)	were	measured	before	and	after	the	intervention.	
The	HRV	was	evaluated	by	24-	h	ambulatory	electrocardiogram.
Results: After	 the	 intervention,	 the	 levels	 of	 FBG,	 2hPG,	 serum	 inflammatory	 fac-
tors,	IL-	6	and	TNF-	α in the exercise group were significantly lower than those in the 
control group (p < .05)	with	no	significant	differences	in	serum	CRP	(p > .05).	After	the	
intervention,	the	HRV	time	domain	and	frequency	domain	indexes	in	the	two	groups	
were significantly improved compared with those before the exercise experiment 
(p < .01)	and	with	no	significant	difference	in	(lnlf)	(p > .05).	The	time-	domain	indexes,	
i.e.,	SDNN	and	RMSSD,	as	well	as	the	frequency	domain	index,	i.e.,	(lnhf),	were	signifi-
cantly higher in the exercise group than in the control group, whereas lnlf/lnhf were 
significantly lower than those in the control group (p < .05).
Conclusions: Compared with routine hypoglycemic drug therapy, combining aerobic 
exercise and resistance training helped to reduce the level of blood glucose and serum 
inflammatory	factors	in	T2DM	patients	with	DCAN,	and	improved	autonomic	nerve	
function.

1  |  INTRODUC TION

Diabetic	 cardiovascular	 autonomic	 neuropathy	 (DCAN)	 is	 one	 of	
the common chronic complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(Henning,	 2018).	 Its	 incidence	 is	 between	 20%	 and	 73%.	 Clinical	
manifestations	 include	decreased	heart	rate	variability	 (HRV),	pos-
tural hypotension and resting tachycardia (Xu et al., 2019).	The	con-
dition can also easily lead to myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac 
death	 and	 painless	myocardial	 ischemia.	 Additionally,	DCAN	 is	 an	
important factor in the death of patients with cardiovascular and 
cerebrovascular	diseases	(Pop-	BusuiR	et	al.,	2017; Cha et al., 2016).	
As	 a	 mature	 and	 noninvasive	 method	 for	 detecting	 cardiac	 auto-
nomic	nerve	function	(sympathetic	and	vagus	nerve	activity),	HRV	
analysis is considered an early index for predicting and diagnosing 
DCAN	(Picard	et	al.,	2021).

Studies have shown that inflammation is involved in the oc-
currence	 and	 development	 of	 type	 2	 diabetes	 mellitus	 (T2DM).	
Inflammatory factors destroy islets through multiple links β Cells, 
which can lead to decreased insulin secretion and insulin resistance 
and	 contribute	 to	 the	 occurrence	 of	 diabetes-	related	 complica-
tions (Chen et al., 2020).	 Lu	 Bingyan,	 a	 domestic	 scholar,	 found	
that	serum	inflammatory	factors,	such	as	C-	reactive	protein	(CRP),	
interleukin-	6	 (IL-	6)	and	 tumor	necrosis	 factor	alpha	 (TNF-	α)	were	
closely	related	to	the	pathogenesis	of	DCAN	(Lu,	2017).	The	cen-
tral nervous system can reduce the production of cytokines by bal-
ancing the activities of the sympathetic nerve or vagus nerve, and 
myocardial ischemic experimental animal models confirmed that 
stimulating the vagus nerve could significantly inhibit the release of 
TNF-	a	and	IL-	6	(Bakkar	et	al.,	2020).	Therefore,	HRV	and	inflamma-
tory factors may play an important role in autonomic nerve injury 
caused by T2DM.

Physical exercise is considered to help prevent the progres-
sion and complications of T2DM by reducing the level of plasma 
inflammatory	markers.	In	addition,	a	study	indicated	that	the	anti-	
inflammatory effect of exercise was related to the type, dose and 
intensity of exercise (Pan et al., 2018).	Balducci	et	al.	(2010)	found	
that, compared with patients with aerobic training only, the reduc-
tion of inflammatory markers in T2DM patients who engaged in 
aerobic	exercise	combined	with	resistance	training	 (AE + RT)	was	
greater.	 It	 is	 thus	 suggested	 that	 AE + RT	 has	 a	 better	 effect	 on	
countering the risk factors of diabetic complications than aerobic 
exercise alone.

Based	 on	 the	 above	 research,	 the	 assumption	 can	 be	 made	
that	 AE + RT	 may	 improve	 cardiac	 autonomic	 regulation	 function	
in patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy by reducing serum 
inflammatory levels. To test this hypothesis, the present study mea-
sured	the	effect	of	12-	week	AE + RT	on	serum	inflammatory	factors	
(IL-	6	and	TNF-	α),	CRP	 level	 and	HRV	 (time	domain	and	 frequency	

domain	indexes)	in	patients	with	T2DM	to	provide	a	theoretical	basis	
for	improving	the	autonomic	nerve	function	of	AE + RT	patients	with	
autonomic neuropathy.

2  |  DATA S AND METHODS

2.1  |  General information

Female	patients	with	T2DM	complicated	with	DCAN	from	January	
2021	to	January	2022	were	selected	as	 the	 research	participants.	
A	 total	of	30	cases	were	selected	by	 random	sampling.	The	 inclu-
sion	criteria	were	as	follows:	(1)	participants	met	the	diagnostic	cri-
teria	of	diabetes	and	DCAN	as	per	China's	guidelines	for	prevention	
and	 treatment	 of	 type	 2	 diabetes	mellitus	 (Clinical	 Guidelines	 for	
Prevention	and	Treatment	of	Geriatric	Diabetes	in	China,	2022);	(2)	
based on a standard diagnosis, patients met the diabetes mellitus 
and autonomic nerve dysfunction criteria (Zhao & Wu, 2013);	(3)	the	
patient	was	female	and	older	than	56 years;	(4)	the	patient	was	not	
taking any drugs that would affect the study outcomes.

The	exclusion	criteria	were	as	follows:	(1)	patients	with	coronary	
heart disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure, hypertension 
and	 hyperthyroidism;	 (2)	 patients	with	 a	 history	 of	myocardial	 in-
farction	and	autonomic	neuropathy	caused	by	other	factors;	(3)	the	
patient had a serious liver and/or kidney disorder, abnormal thyroid 
function,	an	acid-	based	disorder	concerning	water	and	electrolyte	
balance	and	other	diseases;	(4)	an	allergic	constitution	or	a	possible	
allergy to the drugs that were used in this study.

According	to	the	admission	number,	the	patients	were	randomly	
divided	into	the	exercise	(15	cases)	and	the	control	(15	cases)	group,	
respectively.	All	participants	provided	signed	informed	consent	for	
inclusion in the study prior to conducting the trial. Three participants 
withdrew	from	the	study	for	personal	reasons.	Finally,	there	were	14	
participants	in	the	exercise	group	and	13	in	the	control	group.	There	
was no significant difference in general clinical data (age, height, 
weight,	body	mass	index	and	course	of	the	disease)	between	the	two	
groups (p > .05)	as	shown	in	Table 1.

2.2  |  Intervention method

The intervention method was conducted as follows.
The control group received regular treatment for diabetes, in-

cluding amendments to their diet, regular and balanced exercise, 
abstinence from smoking and alcohol and according to their indi-
vidual condition, metformin tablets or subcutaneous injection of in-
sulin	aspartate	was	delivered	to	control	blood	sugar	in	the	required	
range.	For	participants	with	hypertension	and	hyperlipidemia,	 this

was combined with valsartan, atorvastatin and other drugs to con-
trol blood pressure and blood lipid levels in normal ranges. Oral 
mecobalamin	tablets	(0.5	mg,	batch	no.	20151219),	were	also	given	
(0.5	mg	at	a	time,	3	times	a	day).

In the exercise group, patients were treated with routine hy-
poglycemic	drugs	 combined	with	AE + RT,	 three	 times	 a	week,	 for	
60 min	 each	 time.	 The	AE + RT	 (Ma,	2014)	 conditions	were	 as	 fol-
lows:	 aerobic	 exercise	 combined	 with	 resistance	 training,	 60 min	
each	time	(a	warm-	up	session	for	10	min,	formal	training	for	40 min,	
finishing	exercises	for	10	min).	The	aerobic	exercise	included	walk-
ing	 on	 a	 treadmill	 at	 a	medium	 intensity	 (65%–	70%,	 [HRmax])	 for	
20 min.	 Participants	wore	 a	 Polar	watch	 to	monitor	 their	 exercise	
intensity and to accurately judge whether aerobic exercise had 
been	carried	out	within	the	target	heart-	rate	range.	The	resistance	
strength-	training	mainly	comprised	a	dumbbell	(used	alongside	body	
side	flexion,	scissors	deep	squat,	arm	flexion	and	extension,	bend-
ing	lift,	side	flat	lift),	an	elastic	belt	and	other	strength-	training	tools	
and	unarmed	training	techniques	(e.g.,	knee-	bending	sit-	up,	supine	
leg-	lift,	supine	two	head	up,	seated	thigh	adduction	and	small	 leg-	
lift).	Resistance	training	was	carried	out	for	20 min	at	an	exercise	in-
tensity	of	70%–	85%	per	one-	repetition	maximum.	Three	groups	of	
resistance training exercises were completed each time, with resting 
periods	between	each	group	ranging	from	3–	5	min.	Training	inten-
sity	(the	number	of	groups,	exercise	intensity	and	repetition	times)	
was adjusted according to the performance of each participant 
during training.

The following points were strictly followed when implementing 
the exercise instructions.

1.	 The	safety	principle.	Before	implementing	the	exercise	tests,	an	
incremental load exercise test was carried out using a power 
bicycle to determine whether the participants experienced any 
discomfort,	 based	on	 the	American	Sports	Medical	Association	
standards	 (Hill,	 2008).

2. The personalization principle. The specific exercise type was se-
lected,	based	on	the	patient's	hobbies.

3.	 Exercise	intensity	measurement	and	monitoring.	The	first	2 weeks	
focused on adaptation training and learning. Once adaptation and 
mastery had been achieved, steps were taken to ensure that ex-
ercises	were	conducted	at	the	correct	 intensity.	Heart	rate	was	
adopted as the standard for formulating personalized exercise 
intensity as follows: the upper limit of exercise heart rate = 170 
age,	 5–	7	 times/week,	 approximately	 20 min/time,	 or	 60 min	 in	
total, and the exercise routines were completed three times a 
day.	For	patients	with	physical	permission,	exercise	twice	a	day.	

These parameters were combined with subjective exercise inten-
sity	scoring	and	individual	self-	perception	as	a	means	to	monitor	
exercise intensity.

2.3  |  Observation index

2.3.1  |  Serum	inflammatory	factors

All	 the	participants	 took	5	ml	of	elbow	vein	blood	from	the	abdo-
men before the exercise intervention, as well as on the second day 
after the intervention. The blood samples were centrifuged at a low 
temperature	(4°C)	for	10	min	(4,000	R/min)	and	the	serum	was	sepa-
rated.	 The	 serum	 inflammatory	 factors,	 i.e.,	 IL-	6	 and	TNF-	α, were 
measured	 using	 an	 enzyme-	linked	 immunosorbent	 assay	 (Abcam)	
according	to	the	manufacturer's	instructions.	The	fasting	blood	glu-
cose	and	2-	h	postprandial	blood	glucose	were	measured	by	a	fully	
automated	biochemical	analyzer	(Hitachi	7600).

2.3.2  |  Heart	rate	variability	measurement

Before	and	after	conducting	the	experiment,	the	subjects	rested	on	
their	backs	for	15 min	and	then	used	the	12-	channel	recorder	(DMS,	
USA)	to	record	a	24-	h	ambulatory	electrocardiogram.	The	HRV	in-
dexes	recorded	in	a	24-	h	ambulatory	electrocardiogram	were	subse-
quently	analyzed.	The	time-	domain	indexes	included	the	following:	
standard	 deviation	 of	 normal	 sinus	 R-	R	 interval	 (SDNN);	 (MS),	 re-
flecting the overall change in autonomic nerve function; the root 
mean	square	of	the	difference	between	adjacent	normal	R-	R	inter-
vals	(RMSSD)	MS,	reflecting	vagus	nerve	function.

The	 frequency-	domain	 indexes	 included	 the	 following:	 low-	
frequency	power	(LF)	(0.04–	0.15 Hz,	reflecting	cardiac	sympathetic	
nerve	activity),	high-	frequency	power	(HF)	(0.15–	0.40 Hz,	reflecting	
cardiac	vagus	nerve	activity)	and	an	lnlf/lnhf	ratio	reflecting	the	bal-
ance of sympathetic and vagus nerve activity.

2.4  |  Statistical treatment

The SPSS Statistics 21.0 software program was used to analyze 
the	data.	The	measurement	data	were	expressed	as	mean ± stand-
ard deviation using a t-	test,	and	the	counting	data	were	expressed	
as	 percentage	 (%)	 counts	 using	 a	 chi-	square	 test.	 The	 LF	 and	HF	
were first transformed by a natural logarithm to ensure that they

conformed	to	a	normal	distribution.	A	paired	 t-	test	was	applied	to	
compare	the	experimental	data	before	and	after	applying	AE + RT	in	
the	two	groups	(control	and	exercise).	An	independent	sample	t-	test	
was conducted to compare the differences in serum inflammatory 
factors,	blood	glucose	and	HRV	indexes	between	the	groups	before	
and after the exercise intervention. The difference was statistically 
significant (p < .05).

3.1  |  The effect of aerobic exercise and resistance 
training on blood glucose level in elderly type 2 
diabetes mellitus patients

Before	conducting	the	experiment,	there	was	no	significant	differ-
ence	 in	 FBG	 and	 2hPG	 values	 between	 the	 two	 groups	 (p > .05);	
Following	the	intervention,	the	FBG	and	2hPG	values	in	the	control	
and exercise groups decreased significantly compared with those 
before the experiment (p < .01).	The	FBG	and	2hPG	values	in	the	ex-
ercise group were significantly lower than those in the control group 
(t =	2.380,	p = .027; t = 2.256, p =	0.033;	see	Table 2).

3.2  |  The effect of aerobic exercise and resistance 
training on heart rate variability in elderly type 2 
diabetes mellitus patients

Before	conducting	the	experiment,	there	was	no	significant	differ-
ence	 in	 the	HRV	 time-	domain	 (SDNN	and	RMSSD)	and	 frequency	
domain	 indexes	 (lnlf,	 lnhf	 and	 lnlf/lnhf)	 between	 the	 two	 groups	
(p > .05).	 After	 the	 intervention,	 the	 above	 indexes	 in	 the	 control	
and exercise groups decreased significantly compared with those 
before the exercise (p < .01).	There	was	no	significant	difference	in	
the lnlf index between the exercise and the control group (t = 0.605, 
p =	 0.551);	 the	 time	domain	 indexes	 (SDNN	and	RMSSD)	and	 the	
frequency	 domain	 index	 (lnhf)	 in	 the	 exercise	 group	were	 signifi-
cantly higher than those in the control group (t =	−4.409,	p = 0.000; 
t =	 −2.252,	 p =	 0.033;	 t =	 −2.185,	 p =	 0.039).	 The	 Lnlf/lnhf	was	
significantly lower in the exercise group than in the control group 
(t =	2.093,	p = 0.047; see Table 3).

3.3  |  The effect of aerobic exercise and resistance 
training on serum inflammatory factors in elderly type 
2 diabetes mellitus patients

Before	conducting	the	experiment,	there	was	no	significant	differ-
ence	in	the	levels	of	serum	inflammatory	factors	(IL-	6,	CRP	and	TNF-	
α)	between	the	two	groups	(p > .05).	After	the	intervention,	the	levels	
of	IL-	6,	CRP	and	TNF-	α in the exercise group were significantly lower 
compared with before the exercise (p < .01).	The	levels	of	serum	IL-	6	
and	TNF-	α in the exercise group were significantly lower than those 
in the control group (t =	 3.685,	p = 0.001; t =	 2.312,	p =	 0.029).	
There was no significant difference in serum CRP between the two 
groups (t =	1.038,	p =	0.309).	See	Table 4.

4  |  DISCUSSION

The current study examined the combined effect of aerobic exercise 
and	resistance	training	on	serum	inflammatory	factors	and	HRV	in	a	
cohort	of	female	T2DM	patients	with	DCAN.	The	primary	findings	
can	be	summarized	as	follows:	(1)	Compared	with	the	conventional	
treatment of T2DM, the combined exercise strategy can significantly 
reduce	FBG	and	2hPG.	(2)	Compared	with	before	the	intervention,	
the	HRV	 indexes	were	 reduced	 in	 both	 the	 groups;	 however,	 the	
combined	 strategy	 had	 a	more	 prominent	 effect.	 (3)	 There	was	 a	
significant	reduction	in	inflammatory	markers	(IL-	6,	CRP	and	TNF-	α)	
following the implementation of the combined strategy. The present 
study further emphasized the fact that a combined strategy that in-
cluded hypoglycemic drugs, lifestyle changes and exercise was es-
sential for the treatment of T2DM patients. This strategy may help 
to reduce complications and improve patient prognosis.

Diabetes is a global health concern. The disease is expected to affect 
439	million	people	by	2030,	of	which	approximately	85%–	90%	will	
be T2DM (Yang et al., 2017).	Reportedly,	 the	 combination	of	 aero-
bic exercise and resistance training is more beneficial for stabilizing

blood glucose levels and the overall rehabilitation of T2DM patients 
(Mangiamarchi et al., 2017).	 Domestic	 scholar,	 Zhao	 Xiujun	 (Yang	
et al., 2017),	 found	 that	 compared	 with	 T2DM	 patients	 who	 only	
participated in aerobic exercise, aerobic exercise combined with re-
sistance training could better control blood glucose levels and gly-
cosylated hemoglobin in T2DM patients. In the present study, after 

12 weeks	of	aerobic	exercise	combined	with	resistance	training,	the	
fasting	blood	glucose	and	2hPG	of	the	middle-	aged	and	elderly	T2DM	
patients in the exercise group had decreased significantly. This result 
was consistent with the research results of the studies denoted above.

Research indicated that aerobic training involved the continuous 
activity of multiple large muscle groups, and that resistance training

could	 increase	muscle	strength.	An	 increase	 in	 large	muscle	group	
activity and muscle strength can make the body more sensitive to 
insulin, promote expression of the glucose transporter gene and 
stimulate the intake of glucose by cells, resulting in the reduction of 
glucose (Wormgoor et al., 2017).	Accordingly,	aerobic	exercise	com-
bined with resistance training may be a safe and effective auxiliary 
rehabilitation scheme for T2DM patients.

4.2  |  The effect of aerobic exercise and resistance 
training on heart rate variability in elderly type 2 
diabetes mellitus patients

Research	 has	 shown	 that	 physical	 exercise	 is	 a	 low-	cost	 and	 ef-
ficient intervention method for autonomic nerve dysfunction in 
cases	of	T2DM	(Bhati	et	al.,	2018).	Compared	with	a	single	exercise,	
aerobic exercise, combined with resistance training, has a better ef-
fect on the improvement of cardiovascular autonomic nerve func-
tion (Sanches et al., 2015).	Pagkalos	et	al.	 (2008)	found	that	after	
6	months	of	aerobic	exercise	(exercise	intensity	70%–	85%	HRmax,	
3	times/week),	the	SDNN,	RMSSD	and	pNN50	of	T2DM	patients	
with	and	without	DCAN	had	increased	significantly.	However,	HF	
and	LF	increased	significantly	in	T2DM	patients	with	DCAN,	sug-
gesting that exercise had a better effect on T2DM patients with 
cardiac autonomic neuropathy. The results of the current study are 
consistent with those presented in (Pagkalos et al., 2008).	 After	
12 weeks	 of	 aerobic	 exercise	 combined	 with	 resistance	 training,	
the	HRV	indexes	in	the	time	and	frequency	domains	in	the	control	
and exercise groups decreased significantly compared with those 
before exercise. Compared with the control group, the combined 
exercise types significantly increased the time domain indexes 
(SDNN,	RMSSD),	as	well	as	the	frequency	domain	indexes	(HF/LF)	
in	T2DM	patients	with	DCAN,	but	there	was	no	significant	differ-
ence	in	LF	values.

It is suggested that aerobic exercise combined with resistance 
training can help prevent and control cardiovascular autonomic neu-
ropathy in T2DM patients. The different research results obtained 
for a variety of studies may be related to the selection of participants 
(those	with/without	DCAN).	In	addition,	(Weng	et	al.,	2018)	found	
that	FBG	and	2hPG	were	the	main	 risk	 factors	 for	abnormal	HRV.	
Therefore, the improvement of cardiac autonomic nerve function in 
T2DM	patients	with	DCAN	may	be	related	to	the	reduction	of	FBG	
and	2hPG	levels	in	T2DM	patients.

4.3  |  The effect of aerobic exercise and resistance 
training on serum inflammatory factors in elderly type 
2 diabetes mellitus patients

Inflammation	 theory	 suggests	 that	 a	 chronic	 low-	grade	 inflam-
matory response is related to the pathogenesis and related com-
plications	 of	 T2DM,	 and	 serum	 IL-	1,	 IL-	6	 and	 TNF	 increase	with	
the age and disease course of T2DM patients. The level showed 

an upward trend. Recent studies found that physical activity and 
exercise training could help to prevent the development and com-
plications of T2DM by reducing the level of plasma inflammatory 
markers	(Bellavere	et	al.,	2018).	However,	there	are	different	con-
clusions on the effect of exercise on inflammatory factors, which 
may be related to different training programs. Studies showed 
that compared with aerobic exercise, aerobic exercise combined 
with	 resistance	 training	 and	 high-	intensity	 exercise	 significantly	
reduced	serum	CRP	and	IL-	6	 levels	 in	T2DM	patients	with	meta-
bolic syndrome, which was not related to weight loss (Seyedizadeh 
et al., 2020).	It	is	suggested	that	long-	term	high-	intensity	exercise,	
particularly	mixed	training,	will	have	a	better	anti-	inflammatory	ef-
fect. Some scholars believe that aerobic exercise combined with 
resistance	 training	 can	 reduce	 serum	 inflammatory	 factors	 IL-	6	
and	TNF-		α levels and improve metabolic abnormalities in T2DM 
patients,	thereby	reducing	the	harmful	effects	of	diabetes-	related	
inflammation on health (Cassidy et al., 2019).	The	results	obtained	
in	 this	study	 indicated	similar	outcomes.	After	12 weeks	of	aero-
bic exercise combined with resistance training, compared with the 
control group, the group that participated in combined exercise 
types	 had	 significantly	 reduced	 serum	 IL-	6	 and	 TNF	 in	 patients	
with	T2DM-		α and CRP levels. Studies suggested that in healthy 
individuals	 and	 patients	 with	 cardiovascular	 disease,	 HRV	 was	
related	 to	 inflammatory	 markers	 IL-	6,	 TNF-	α and CRP (Williams 
et al., 2019).	Shen	et	al.	(2018)	noted	that	effective	blood	glucose	
control may reduce the level of serum inflammation in T2DM pa-
tients	for	controlling	DCAN.

In	 conclusion,	 the	 improvement	 of	 HRV	 in	 T2DM	 patients	 by	
12-	week	aerobic	exercise	combined	with	resistance	training	may	be	
related to the reduction of blood glucose levels and inflammatory 
state.	However,	the	specific	mechanism	in	this	regard	requires	fur-
ther investigation.

The	limitations	of	the	current	study	are	as	follows:	(1)	a	small	sam-
ple	size;	(2)	due	to	the	limitation	of	single	disease	medical	insurance	
amount,	 the	short	 intervention	 time	and	no	subsequent	 follow-	up	
data,	it	was	impossible	to	obtain	the	long-	term	effect	of	AE + RT	ex-
ercise	intervention	in	T2DM	patients	with	DCAN.	Therefore,	in	the	
future,	the	researchers	will	have	to	conduct	longer-	term	follow-	ups	
with larger sample sizes, as well as additional prospective studies to 
further confirm the results presented herein.

5  |  CONCLUSION

Compared with the use of hypoglycemic drugs only, routine hypo-
glycemic	drug	therapy	combined	with	AE + RT	exercise	reduced	the	
level of blood glucose and serum inflammatory factors and improved 
autonomic nerve function in patients with T2DM complicated with 
DCAN.	 Therefore,	 the	 experiment	 herein	 can	 help	 to	 control	 car-
diovascular	 autonomic	 neuropathy	 in	 T2DM	patients	with	DCAN.	
However,	in	the	future,	longer-	term	follow-	up	is	needed	to	verify	the	
long-	term	effect	of	AE + RT	exercise	intervention	in	T2DM	patients	
with	DCAN.
