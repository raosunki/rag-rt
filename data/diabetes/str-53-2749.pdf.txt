BACKGROUND: GLP-1 RA (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists), including semaglutide, may reduce stroke risk in people 
with type 2 diabetes. This post hoc analysis examined the subcutaneous and oral semaglutide effects, versus placebo, on 
stroke and its subtypes in people with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk.

METHODS: SUSTAIN 6 (Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long-Term Outcomes With Semaglutide in 
Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes) and PIONEER 6 (Peptide Innovation for Early Diabetes Treatment) were randomized 
cardiovascular outcome trials of subcutaneous and oral semaglutide in people with type 2 diabetes at high 
cardiovascular risk, respectively. Time to first stroke and stroke subtypes were analyzed using a Cox proportional 
hazards model stratified by trial with pooled treatment as a factor. The impact of prior stroke, prior myocardial 
infarction or stroke, age, sex, systolic blood pressure, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and prior atrial fibrillation 
on treatment effects was assessed using interaction P values. Risk of major adverse cardiovascular event was 
analyzed according to prior stroke.

RESULTS: A total of 106/6480 participants had a stroke (1.0 event/100 patient-years of observation [PYO]). 
Semaglutide reduced incidence of any stroke versus placebo (0.8 versus 1.1 events/100 PYO; hazard ratio, 0.68 
[95% CI, 0.46–1.00]; P=0.048), driven by significant reductions in risk of small-vessel occlusion (0.3 versus 0.7 
events/100 PYO; hazard ratio, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.29–0.89]; P=0.017). Hazard ratios for risk of any stroke with 
semaglutide versus placebo were 0.60 (95% CI, 0.37–0.99; 0.5 versus 0.9 events/100 PYO) and 0.89 (95% CI, 
0.47–1.69; 2.7 versus 3.0 events/100 PYO) in those without and with prior stroke, respectively. Except for prior 
atrial fibrillation (Pinteraction=0.025), no significant interactions were observed between treatment effects on risk of any 
stroke and subgroups investigated, or between treatment effects on risk of major adverse cardiovascular event and 
prior stroke (Pinteraction >0.05 for all).

CONCLUSIONS: Semaglutide reduced incidence of any first stroke during the trials versus placebo in people with type 2 
diabetes at high cardiovascular risk, primarily driven by small-vessel occlusion prevention. Semaglutide treatment, versus 
placebo, lowered the risk of stroke irrespective of prior stroke at baseline.

As the prevalence of diabetes is rapidly increasing, the 
number of people with complications, including stroke, 
is expected to increase.1 Epidemiological studies show 

that diabetes increases the risk of stroke by ≈2-fold.2 The 
prevalence of stroke was 18.6% in people with type 2 
diabetes (T2D) in 2015.3 People with diabetes are more 
likely to have a stroke at a younger age, with worse out-
comes and higher risk for recurrence compared with those 
without diabetes.4,5 The 10-year recurrence rate of stroke 
was reported to be 11.2% in people who had a stroke,6 
and those with diabetes had 45% to 60% higher risk of 
stroke recurrence than those without diabetes.7,8 This sug-
gests that diabetes is an independent risk factor for stroke 
recurrence.8 Among the subtypes of strokes, cerebral small 
vessel disease is more common in people with T2D, com-
pared with those without T2D. Thus, prevention of stroke, 
including all its subtypes, should be a major concern in the 
clinical management of people with diabetes.

Accumulating evidence suggests that GLP-1 RAs 
(glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists) may reduce 
the risk of stroke beyond their glycemic impact in people 
with T2D.9–14 Currently, there are 5 available subcutane-
ous (SC) GLP-1 RAs (exenatide, lixisenatide, liraglutide, 
dulaglutide, and semaglutide)15,16 and one oral formu-
lation (once-daily oral semaglutide).15 In a large meta-
analysis of recent cardiovascular outcome trials, GLP-1 
RAs were reported to reduce the risk of stroke signifi-
cantly in people with T2D compared with placebo (haz-
ard ratio [HR], 0.83 [95% CI, 0.76–0.92]; P=0.0002).14 
The American Heart Association/American Stroke Asso-
ciation as well as endocrinology and cardiology guide-
lines recommend the use of GLP-1 RAs with evidence 
of cardiovascular benefit for individuals at high/very 
high cardiovascular risk regardless of glycemic control 

to reduce the risk of future vascular events.7,17,18 Despite 
the short duration of the trials, semaglutide has dem-
onstrated a consistent reduction in major adverse car-
diovascular events (MACEs) in the SUSTAIN 6 (Trial to 
Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long-Term Outcomes 
With Semaglutide in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes), with 
once-weekly SC semaglutide,19 and the PIONEER (Pep-
tide Innovation for Early Diabetes Treatment) 6 trial, with 
once-daily oral semaglutide.20

The present post hoc analysis, therefore, aimed 
to examine the effect of semaglutide, irrespective of 
whether administered subcutaneously or orally, on stroke 
risk, stratified by subtype, in people with T2D at high car-
diovascular risk, using pooled data from the SUSTAIN 6 
and PIONEER 6 trials.

METHODS
De-identified individual participant data and redacted Clinical 
Study Report will be available according to Novo Nordisk data 
sharing commitments.

Trial Overview
SUSTAIN 6 (NCT01720446) and PIONEER 6 (NCT02692716) 
were global, randomized, phase 3 trials assessing the cardio-
vascular safety of once-weekly SC and once-daily oral sema-
glutide versus placebo, respectively.19,20 People with T2D aged 
≥50 years with established cardiovascular disease (myocar-
dial infarction, history of symptomatic coronary heart disease, 
coronary, carotid or peripheral arterial revascularization, stroke, 
transient ischemic attacks, >50% stenosis of coronary, carotid 
or lower extremities arteries), chronic heart failure or chronic 
kidney disease, or ≥60 years with cardiovascular risk factors 
were included in both trials.19,20 Stroke was defined as an acute 
episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal or global 
brain, spinal cord, or retinal vascular injury, and transient isch-
emic attacks (as used in the inclusion criteria of both trials) was 
defined as a transient (<24 hours) episode of neurological dys-
function caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia, 
without acute infarction.19 Fatal and nonfatal strokes were adju-
dicated by an independent adjudication committee.19,20 Detailed 
protocols and trial-specific flow diagrams can be found in the 
primary SUSTAIN 6 and PIONEER 6 publications.19,20

Both SUSTAIN 6 and PIONEER 6 were approved by ethics 
committees and institutional review boards and were conducted 
according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All 
participants provided written informed consent before partici-
pation in trial-related activities.19,20

Post Hoc Analysis
In this exploratory post hoc analysis, the effects of semaglutide 
versus placebo on time to first occurrence of any type of stroke 
(fatal and nonfatal; transient ischemic attacks were not included) 
and stroke subtypes, including ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, 
as well as unknown subtypes‚ were investigated. Based on the 
Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment criteria,21 ischemic 
strokes (positively adjudicated events) were further sub-classified 
into (1) large artery atherosclerosis, (2) cardioembolism, (3)

small-vessel occlusion, (4) stroke of other determined cause, and 
(5) stroke of undetermined cause, by an external blinded stroke 
physician. In a subgroup analysis, effects of treatment on time 
to occurrence of any stroke were determined in relation to prior 
stroke (yes/no), prior myocardial infarction or stroke (yes or no), 
prior atrial fibrillation (AF; yes or no), age (<75 or ≥75 years), sex 
(female or male), systolic blood pressure (SBP; <120, ≥120 and 
≤140, or >140 mm Hg), and estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(<60 or ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2). Some of these subgroups were 
related to the prespecified subgroup analyses for time to first 
MACE in the primary publications19,20 while the others, including 
prior stroke, prior AF‚ and SBP, were chosen as they were rel-
evant end points related to stroke. The impact of prior stroke on 
the effect of semaglutide versus placebo on subsequent MACE 
within the trials was also analyzed. Furthermore, a dose-response 
analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of individual doses 
(0.5 mg SC, 1.0 mg SC, and 14 mg oral) of semaglutide versus 
placebo on time to first occurrence of any stroke. A CONSORT 
checklist of the current post hoc analysis has been included in the 
Supplemental Material.

Statistical Analysis
Data from SUSTAIN 6 and PIONEER 6 were pooled in this 
analysis, except for the dose-response analysis, where data 
for individual doses of semaglutide were used, as well as the 
Aalen-Johansen plots when they were analyzed for individual 
SUSTAIN 6 and PIONEER 6 trials.

The Aalen-Johansen estimator, a nonparametric estimator of 
cumulative incidence, was used to calculate the cumulative inci-
dence rates for time to first stroke during the trials, hereby adjust-
ing for all-cause death as a competing risk.22 This analysis was 
performed with data from SUSTAIN 6 and PIONEER 6, pooled 
and individually. A Cox proportional hazards model stratified by 
trial with treatment (pooled semaglutide) as a factor was used 
to examine treatment effects for time to first occurrence of an 
event. A trial-specific analysis was also performed to investigate 
whether this treatment effect was homogenous across SUSTAIN 
6 and PIOPNEER 6. For the subgroup analyses, subgroups were 
added as a categorical fixed factor and as an interaction term with 
treatment. Potential heterogeneity of treatment effect across the 
subgroups according to prior stroke, prior myocardial infarction or 
stroke, prior AF, age, sex, SBP, and estimated glomerular filtration 
rate on time to first occurrence of any stroke during the trials was 
assessed using interaction P values. All analyses were performed 
using Statistical Analysis System version 9.4 (SAS/STAT 15.1). 
A P value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. No 
adjustment for multiple testing was performed, and no direction of 
any subgroup-treatment effect interaction had been prespecified.

had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.

RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics
In total, SUSTAIN 6 and PIONEER 6 included 6480  
(semaglutide, n=3239; placebo, n=3241) participants, of 
whom 106 had a stroke and 6374 did not have a stroke 
during the trials. The mean age of people (±SD) with-
out stroke was 65.4±7.3 years, with the majority of them 
being male (64.5%), and the mean duration of diabetes 
was 14.4±8.3 years (Table). The baseline characteristics of 
people with stroke during the trials treated with semaglutide 
(n=43) were similar to those treated with placebo (n=63; 
Table). However, prior stroke (39.5% versus 33.3%) and 
established cardiovascular disease (93.0% versus 84.1%) 
were higher in the semaglutide group compared with the 
placebo group among these individuals (Table).

Time to First Stroke and Stroke Subtypes
The incident rate of any first stroke during the tri-
als was 1.0 event/100 patient-years of observation 

[PYO]). Administration of semaglutide reduced the risk 
of any first stroke in the trials compared with placebo 
(incidence rate: 0.8 versus 1.1 events per 100 PYO; 
HR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.46–1.00]; P=0.048; Figure 1), 
with no difference in effect between stroke subtypes: 
ischemic stroke (incidence rate: 0.7 versus 1.0 events 
per 100 PYO; HR, 0.72, [95% CI, 0.47–1.08]; P=0.11) 
and hemorrhagic stroke (incidence rate: 0.1 versus 0.1 
events per 100 PYO; HR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.12–1.99]; 
P=0.32; Figure 2).

Among the Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treat-
ment subcategories, small vessel occlusion was the only 
subcategory to demonstrate a significant treatment dif-
ference with semaglutide versus placebo (incidence rate: 
0.3 versus 0.7 events per 100 PYO; HR, 0.51 [95% CI, 
0.29–0.89]; P=0.017; Figure 2).

The effects on risk of any first stroke in the trials with 
semaglutide versus placebo were consistent in SUS-
TAIN 6 (incidence rate: 0.9 versus 1.4 events per 100 
PYO; HR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.41–1.03]; P=0.07; Figure 
S1) and PIONEER 6 (incidence rate: 0.6 versus 0.8 
events per 100 PYO; HR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.37–1.56]; 
P=0.45; Figure S2). These were also consistent across 
the doses used in SUSTAIN 6 (semaglutide 1.0 mg SC 
versus placebo, incidence rate: 0.8 versus 1.4 events

per 100 PYO; HR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.30–1.03]; P=0.06, 
and semaglutide 0.5 mg SC versus placebo, incidence 
rate: 1.0 versus 1.4 events per 100 PYO; HR, 0.74 
[95% CI, 0.43–1.30]; P=0.30).

Subgroup Analysis
Data were analyzed using several different baseline 
characteristics (such as prior stroke [yes/no], prior myo-
cardial infarction or stroke [yes or no], prior AF [yes or 
no], age [<75 or ≥75 years], sex [female or male], SBP 
[<120, ≥120 and ≤140, or >140 mm Hg], and estimated 
glomerular filtration rate [<60 or ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2]). 
In the subgroup analysis, the risk of any stroke was gen-
erally lower in the semaglutide group compared with pla-
cebo, except for those with prior AF and those aged ≥75 
years (Figure 3). Of note, the incidence of any stroke 
was nominally reduced in the semaglutide group with-
out history of prior stroke (incidence rate: 0.5 versus 0.9 
events per 100 PYO; HR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.37–0.99]) 
compared with placebo (Figure 3). However, there were 
no significant interactions between the treatment effects 
on the risk of any stroke and the investigated subgroups, 
except for prior AF (Pinteraction=0.025), although the num-
ber of events was very low in the prior AF group (7 ver-
sus 1 event; Figure 3).

Time to First MACE
There were no significant interactions between treatment 
effects on risk of MACE and the prior stroke subgroups 
(Pinteraction=0.56). With semaglutide versus placebo, the inci-
dence rate of MACE was significantly lower among people 
without prior stroke (2.8 versus 3.8 events per 100 PYO; 
HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.59–0.92]; P=0.007) and numerically 
lower in those with prior stroke (5.2 versus 6.0 events per 
100 PYO; HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.54–1.36]; P=0.52).

DISCUSSION
In this post hoc analysis of pooled data from the SUS-
TAIN 6 and PIONEER 6 trials, semaglutide treatment 
reduced the risk of any stroke in people with T2D at high 
cardiovascular risk compared with placebo. Furthermore, 
semaglutide reduced the risk of MACE regardless of 
prior stroke. Overall, semaglutide showed an encourag-
ing trend for stroke prevention regardless of stroke his-
tory and other baseline characteristics.

Recent studies have also suggested a beneficial role 
of GLP-1 RAs in the prevention of stroke, MACE, and 
cardiovascular mortality.23 Consistent with the current 
post hoc analysis, a recent systematic review that evalu-
ated the composite outcomes of MACE reported that

Figure 2. Effect of semaglutide versus placebo on risk of any stroke and stroke subtypes in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) 
at high cardiovascular (CV) risk, based on pooled data from the SUSTAIN 6 (Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long-
Term Outcomes With Semaglutide in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes) and PIONEER 6 (Peptide Innovation for Early Diabetes 
Treatment) trials.
Data for any stroke and those subtypes based on the TOAST (Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) criteria have been included 
(transient ischemic attacks were not included in this analysis). Any stroke (including fatal and nonfatal strokes) and the 3 main subtypes 
were confirmed by the trial-specific Event Adjudication Committee. A Cox proportional hazards model stratified by trial with treatment (pooled 
semaglutide vs placebo) as a factor was used to examine treatment effects. The trial-specific analysis showed that the treatment effects were 
homogenous across SUSTAIN 6 (hazard ratio [HR], 0.65 [95% CI, 0.41–1.03]) and PIONEER 6 (HR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.37–1.56]), Pinteraction=0.73. 
*Ischemic strokes were subcategorized according to TOAST criteria,21 by an external, blinded reviewer. †Included patients with ≥2 causes of 
stroke, undetermined cause despite extensive evaluation, and cause of stroke not known due to cursory evaluation. n indicates number of patients 
with specified stroke type; N, number of patients in the treatment group; and N/A, not applicable.

Strain et al Effects of Semaglutide on Stroke Subtypes in T2D

GLP-1 RAs were associated with significant reduction 
in the relative risk of stroke (as an individual component 
of MACE; HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.77–0.97]; P=0.012).24 Of 
note, in the current study, the significant stroke benefit 
was driven by a significant reduction in risk of small ves-
sel occlusion with semaglutide versus placebo.

Data analyzed from the REWIND (Researching Car-
diovascular Events With a Weekly Incretin in Diabetes) 
trial showed that dulaglutide reduced the risk of isch-
emic stroke (HR, 0.75 [CI, 0.59–0.94]; P=0.012) but not 
hemorrhagic stroke (HR, 1.05 [CI, 0.55–1.99]; P=0.89), 
with no effect on stroke severity.25 However, in the cur-
rent post hoc analysis, although semaglutide reduced the 
risk of any stroke, there were too few hemorrhagic stroke 
outcomes to determine any specific effect.

The effects on risk of any stroke with semaglutide 
versus placebo were consistent in SUSTAIN 6 and 

PIONEER 6, and across the doses used in these trials 
(weekly 0.5 mg [SC], 1.0 mg [SC], or daily 14 mg [oral]). 
The pharmacokinetic profiles of SC and oral semaglutide 
are comparable, with similar exposure-response rela-
tionships noted for efficacy and tolerability irrespective 
of the route of administration.19,20 The outcomes noted 
in SUSTAIN 6 and PIONEER 6 support the use of either 
route due to the similar clinical benefits and cardiovas-
cular effects following oral or SC administration.19,20

The interaction between the effects of semaglutide 
on participants with and without AF is an interesting 
observation, given that previous cardiovascular outcome 
trials have reported no differences in the AF incidence in 
people receiving GLP-1 RAs compared with placebo.26 
This finding must be interpreted with caution given that 
this was based on only 8 events in those with a past his-
tory of AF.

stroke, age, sex, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) 
at high cardiovascular (CV) risk, based on pooled data from the (Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long-Term Outcomes 
With Semaglutide in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes) and PIONEER 6 (Peptide Innovation for Early Diabetes Treatment) trials.
A Cox proportional hazards model stratified by trial with treatment (pooled semaglutide vs placebo) by subgroups as a fixed factor was used to 
examine treatment effects across the subgroups. AF indicates atrial fibrillation; and HR, hazard ratio.



CLINICAL TRIAL
Strain et al Effects of Semaglutide on Stroke Subtypes in T2D

Stroke. 2022;53:2749–2757. DOI: 10.1161/STROKEAHA.121.037775 September 2022  2755

There are several potential mechanisms for how GLP-1 
RAs may contribute to reduce the risk of stroke in people 
with T2D. Although lowering of HbA1c by GLP-1 RAs 
may mediate their effect on cardiovascular outcomes,27 
GLP-1 RAs can deliver a positive impact on risk of stroke 
directly, as they exert beneficial effects on smooth muscle 
cell, endothelial cell, and immune cell function through 
GLP-1 receptor-dependent and -independent path-
ways.23 Given the speed of divergence of the curves, it is 
unlikely that the pleiotropic effects of GLP-1 RAs, includ-
ing reduction of SBP (by 2 to 3 mm Hg) and low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (by −0.1 to −0.2 mmol/L), along 
with significant weight loss,28 would be responsible for 
the benefit. Treatment with GLP-1 RAs is also consid-
ered to exert a neuroprotective effect and may reduce 
the risk of ischemic strokes.29 A recent systematic review 
has also reported the effects of GLP-1 RAs in reduc-
ing ischemic-reperfusion injury in animal models of acute 
ischemic stroke.30 GLP-1 RAs improve neuronal survival, 
reducing infarct size by up to 75% in rat models of tran-
sient middle cerebral artery occlusion.30 GLP-1 RAs also 
generally increase microvascular recruitment and cere-
bral blood flow, and reduce inflammation, vascular smooth 
muscle proliferation, oxidative stress‚ carotid intimal-
media thickness and other markers of atherosclerosis, 
thereby affecting both small and large blood vessels.30,31 
While these mechanisms are likely to explain the impact 
of semaglutide on small vessel strokes, it is possible that 
there were too few events of large artery disease to allow 
any significant effects to be measured.

The safety of semaglutide has been studied in a num-
ber of phase 3 trials—semaglutide was associated with 
fewer serious adverse events versus placebo, although 
more patients discontinued semaglutide due to adverse 
events, mainly gastrointestinal.32,33

This present study had several limitations. First, the 
study was an exploratory post hoc analysis, and some 
baseline characteristics were not protected by the trial 
randomization, resulting in heterogeneous subgroups. 
This type of analysis is only hypothesis-forming, and 
those hypotheses will need to be examined in dedicated 
trials. Second, due to the low number of people within 
the subgroups of interest and limited number of events, 
there is limited statistical power to determine the effects 
of semaglutide. Further studies with larger patient popu-
lations are necessary to establish the specific effects of 
semaglutide, such as any differential effects in the pri-
mary and secondary prevention of stroke‚ and examine 
our findings conclusively.

CONCLUSIONS
The present post hoc analysis revealed that sema-
glutide reduced the risk of any stroke compared with 
placebo in people with T2D at high cardiovascular 
risk, an effect that appeared to be mediated mainly 

through a significant reduction in risk of small ves-
sel occlusion. Compared with placebo, treatment with 
semaglutide lowered the risk of stroke irrespective of 
prior stroke.
