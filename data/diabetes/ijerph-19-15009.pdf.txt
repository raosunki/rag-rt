Abstract: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are at a three-fold increased risk of developing
sarcopenia compared to those without diabetes. The objective of this study was to investigate whether
an intervention involving progressive sandbag exercises is beneficial to patients with T2DM and
possible sarcopenia in terms of enhancing muscle strength and controlling blood sugar levels. Forty
patients with T2DM and possible sarcopenia (age > 50 years) were recruited and randomly divided
into resistance training and control groups. Resistance exercises for the upper and lower extremities
were performed using sandbags (0.5 kg at the beginning to 1 kg after 1 month). Patients in the
control group were asked to maintain their usual daily lifestyle. After 12 weeks, the training group
were significant better than the control group in terms of glycosylated hemoglobin, the five times
sit-to-stand test, skeletal muscle mass and calf circumference, and the physiological domain of the
World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire. In conclusion, these simple home exercises
are beneficial to patients with T2DM combined with possible sarcopenia. This approach can assist
patients in controlling their levels of glycosylated hemoglobin as well as improve physical fitness and
quality of life.

1. Introduction

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by
hyperglycemia. It accounts for 90% of diabetes cases, and is one of the most common
endocrine and metabolic diseases. According to data from the International Diabetes
Federation, the number of patients with diabetes worldwide reached 537 million in 2021;
it is estimated that this number will increase to 783 million by 2045 [1]. The main cause of
T2DM is insufficient β-cell secretion or tissue insulin resistance (IR). It has been proposed
that IR of skeletal muscle is the first metabolic defect in patients with T2DM. Accounting for
70–80% of insulin-mediated glucose uptake in the skeletal muscles when blood sugar levels
are normal and >90% under hyperglycemia [2]. According to currently available evidence,
mechanisms related to T2DM include the accumulation of glycation end products caused
by IR, inflammatory response, and hyperglycemia [3]. These effects result in deterioration
of muscle strength and muscle mass in patients with diabetes and lead to the development
of sarcopenia. The rate of sarcopenia is three-fold higher in patients with T2DM than in
individuals without diabetes [4].

The more physical activity a patient undertakes, the more effective this is in preventing
the occurrence of T2DM with sarcopenia [5]. According to the exercise guidelines estab-
lished by the American Diabetes Association, patients with diabetes should perform at least

150 min of aerobic exercise and resistance training at least two to three times per week, and
follow the principle of progressive resistance training [6]. Previous studies have shown that
aerobic exercise was more effective than resistance exercise in controlling blood sugar [7,8];
however, other studies demonstrated that resistance training was also beneficial for the
control of blood sugar levels in patients with T2DM [9,10]. In addition, the quality of life of
patients with diabetes is lower than that of healthy individuals due to the psychological
impact of blood sugar control or complications [11]. Moreover, the muscle strength and
muscle mass loss of patients may reduce physical activity [12], and it also increases the risk
of falls and hospitalization and reduces the quality of life.

Previous studies have shown that high-intensity resistance training (~80% one-repetition
maximum) increases muscle strength [13,14]. However, if safety is the main consideration,
high-repetition/low-resistance training is better than high-resistance/low-repetition train-
ing; the former type of exercise is more feasible for elderly patients than the latter type.
In some studies, progressive low-resistance training also exerted a similar beneficial effect on
muscle strength [15]. Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the availability of effective home
rehabilitation exercises is crucial for patients with T2DM combined with sarcopenia. Elastic
bands are often used as home resistance training instruments. They have been utilized by
elderly patients [16] and those with sarcopenia and diabetes to improve muscle strength [17].
However, it is difficult to quantify the training intensity performed by a person using elastic
bands, and this type of training is therefore associated with more inconsistent results [16,17].
Moreover, as elastic bands need to be stretched by the user’s strength, there is a certain skill
requirement during training. Wearing sandbags on the extremities has been used by patients
with stroke in treadmill training to improve gait, thereby improving balance. The purpose of
the present study was to investigate whether wearing sandbags as resistance when performing
a home-based exercise program may benefit patients with T2DM combined with possible
sarcopenia in terms of glycemic control (glycated hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c]), and also improve
their muscle strength (grip strength), physical function (five-time chair stand test), skeletal
muscle mass and calf circumference, and quality of life.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Design and Setting

This prospective, randomized, controlled trial was reviewed and approved by the
Institutional Review Board of Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (202001276B0)
and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04647617). Patients were recruited from the
cases of the Pay-for-Performance Program for Diabetes under National Health Insurance
in Taiwan and treated as outpatients in the Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism
of Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. The clinical staff took the initiative to
approach patients who met the inclusion criteria during routine health education. Written
informed consent was obtained from eligible patients after explaining the purpose of
the study. Subsequently, the serial number of each patient’s visit was used to randomly
assign them to either the resistance training (odd number) or control group (even number).
Muscle strength, physical performance, HbA1c levels, blood fat parameters, muscle mass,
calf circumference, and quality of life of all enrolled patients were examined before and
after 12 weeks of intervention. The parameters of HbA1c and blood fat were measured at
the Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital Laboratory; all other data measurements
were conducted by a single researcher in the outpatient clinic of the Endocrinology and
Metabolism Department.

2.2. Patients

The inclusion criteria of this study were: (1) diagnosis of T2DM by endocrinologists
and metabolism physicians according to the disease diagnosis code (ICD-10: E110) for
patients with T2DM; (2) age > 50 years; and (3) meeting the detection criteria for possible
sarcopenia proposed by the 2019 Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (including calf

circumference of <34 cm and <33 cm at the largest circle of respectively male and female
calves; and grip strength of <28 kg and <18 kg for males and females, respectively).

The exclusion criteria were as follows: peripheral neuropathy; retinopathy; stroke;
diabetic foot or amputation; history of myocardial infarction; advanced renal disease;
malignant hypertension; or a history of falls and unstable gait. Throughout the study,
prescription drugs used by the patients were not adjusted.

2.3. Intervention
2.3.1. Resistance Training Group

To accommodate the elderly patients in this study, we intended to design an easy and
safe home resistance training exercise. The training muscles are mainly the functional muscles
of the limbs. Sandbags were utilized as the resistance training equipment. The patients were
instructed on the exercises by the clinical staff during a visit to the outpatient department.
The exercises consisted of arm curl (elbow flexion/extension), overhead press (shoulder),
hip adduction/abduction, step (hip and knee flexion/extension), and tiptoe (ankle flex-
ion/extension) (Figure 1). Initially, a sandbag weighing 0.5 kg was worn, and each exercise
was performed 8–15 times, reaching a rated perceived exertion (RPE) of 13 (range: 6–20),
which was perceived as somewhat hard. The training exercises included 5–10 min of warm-up
and cool-down before and after the main exercise to prevent muscle soreness and injury.
The main exercise consisted of three sets with 1–2 min of rest between sets; the total duration
of each exercise was approximately 30 min. Based on the recommendation in the guidelines of
the American College of Sports Medicine, patients should perform strength training exercises
three times weekly. Participants’ adherence to the exercise program was tracked by phone
call or social software once weekly. Exercises were intensified by adding repetitions of each
movement until the patients could easily perform 20 repetitions. Subsequently, the weight
of the sandbags was changed to 1 kg. To ensure the quality and safety of exercises at home,
patients and their families were required to test whether all required movements could be
performed correctly in the education room. Each participant also received a handout with
demonstration photos as a reminder.

2.2. Patients 
The inclusion criteria of this study were: (1) diagnosis of T2DM by endocrinologists 

and metabolism physicians according to the disease diagnosis code (ICD-10: E110) for pa-
tients with T2DM; (2) age >50 years; and (3) meeting the detection criteria for possible 
sarcopenia proposed by the 2019 Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (including calf cir-
cumference of <34 cm and <33 cm at the largest circle of respectively male and female 
calves; and grip strength of <28 kg and <18 kg for males and females, respectively). 

The exclusion criteria were as follows: peripheral neuropathy; retinopathy; stroke; 
diabetic foot or amputation; history of myocardial infarction; advanced renal disease; ma-
lignant hypertension; or a history of falls and unstable gait. Throughout the study, pre-
scription drugs used by the patients were not adjusted.

To accommodate the elderly patients in this study, we intended to design an easy 
and safe home resistance training exercise. The training muscles are mainly the functional 
muscles of the limbs. Sandbags were utilized as the resistance training equipment. The 
patients were instructed on the exercises by the clinical staff during a visit to the outpa-
tient department. The exercises consisted of arm curl (elbow flexion/extension), overhead

toe (ankle flexion/extension) (Figure 1). Initially, a sandbag weighing 0.5 kg was worn,

2.3.2. Control Group 
Patients in the control group were asked to maintain their usual daily lifestyle as 

much as possible. 

2.4. Outcome Measures 
2.4.1. Biochemical Analysis 

Blood glucose levels are representative of the short-term blood sugar control situa-
tion, and the levels of HbA1c in the blood reflect the blood sugar control status during a 
period of 3 months [18]. The normal levels of HbA1c range between 4% and 5.6%; levels 
> 6.5% are indicative of diabetes. In this study, the levels of HbA1c were measured using 
a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (Premier Hb9210; Bray, Kan-
sas City, MO, USA). 

Blood lipids, mainly including triglyceride and total cholesterol, are insoluble lipids, 
mainly originating from dietary patterns and liver synthesis and also tested in this study. 
Total cholesterol is divided into low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipopro-
tein (HDL). 

2.4.2. Grip Strength 
Grip strength is generally regarded as the most convenient parameter for assessing 

muscle strength. It is also an indicator used for the diagnosis of sarcopenia. In the present 
study, an electronic digital grip strength dynamometer (TKK; Takei Scientific Instru-
ments, Tokyo, Japan) was used for testing. First the width of the grip was adjusted. The 
ideal width is an angle of 90° between the second knuckle of the index finger and the grip. 
The patient then adopted a standing posture with the feet naturally separated, the body 
maintained upright, and the arms naturally relaxed. The patients were asked to practice 
the exercise first and then use the dynamometer to press forcefully and steadily for 5 s. 
The measurement was performed twice, with a 1 min interval between the two recordings, 
and the average value was calculated. 

2.4.3. Five Times Sit-to-Stand Test 
Diagnosis of sarcopenia requires concurrent assessment of the quality and quantity 

of the muscles of elderly individuals (i.e., muscle mass, muscle strength, physical perfor-
mance, etc.). The five times sit-to-stand test is suitable for this purpose. Briefly, the patient 
sat on a chair with a height of approximately 43 cm without armrests. The patient then 
stood up from the chair and then sat down again, carrying out five repetitions and timing 
the total process with a stopwatch. Patients were asked to perform the exercise according 
to their physical condition.

2.3.2. Control Group

Patients in the control group were asked to maintain their usual daily lifestyle as much
as possible.

2.4. Outcome Measures
2.4.1. Biochemical Analysis

Blood glucose levels are representative of the short-term blood sugar control situation,
and the levels of HbA1c in the blood reflect the blood sugar control status during a period
of 3 months [18]. The normal levels of HbA1c range between 4% and 5.6%; levels > 6.5%
are indicative of diabetes. In this study, the levels of HbA1c were measured using a high-
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (Premier Hb9210; Bray, Kansas City,
MO, USA).

Blood lipids, mainly including triglyceride and total cholesterol, are insoluble lipids,
mainly originating from dietary patterns and liver synthesis and also tested in this study. Total
cholesterol is divided into low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL).

2.4.2. Grip Strength

Grip strength is generally regarded as the most convenient parameter for assessing
muscle strength. It is also an indicator used for the diagnosis of sarcopenia. In the present
study, an electronic digital grip strength dynamometer (TKK; Takei Scientific Instruments,
Tokyo, Japan) was used for testing. First the width of the grip was adjusted. The ideal
width is an angle of 90◦ between the second knuckle of the index finger and the grip.
The patient then adopted a standing posture with the feet naturally separated, the body
maintained upright, and the arms naturally relaxed. The patients were asked to practice
the exercise first and then use the dynamometer to press forcefully and steadily for 5 s.
The measurement was performed twice, with a 1 min interval between the two recordings,
and the average value was calculated.

2.4.3. Five Times Sit-to-Stand Test

Diagnosis of sarcopenia requires concurrent assessment of the quality and quantity of
the muscles of elderly individuals (i.e., muscle mass, muscle strength, physical performance,
etc.). The five times sit-to-stand test is suitable for this purpose. Briefly, the patient sat on
a chair with a height of approximately 43 cm without armrests. The patient then stood up
from the chair and then sat down again, carrying out five repetitions and timing the total
process with a stopwatch. Patients were asked to perform the exercise according to their
physical condition.

2.4.4. Muscle Mass

A body composition analyzer (Tanita BC545N; Tanita Corporation, Tokyo, Japan)
was used to measure the appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) and determine the
appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI). Before the test, the patients were asked
to empty their bladder and enter their basic information, including height, weight, age,
gender and other information, on the analyzer screen. Alcohol (75%) was used to wipe
clean the palm surface of the patients and electrodes of the analyzer.

2.4.5. Calf Circumference

Calf circumference is often used to roughly assess the amount of muscle mass. Males
and females with calf circumference measuring <34 cm and <33 cm, respectively, are at
high risk of developing sarcopenia. Patients were asked to take a standing position, and
the largest diameter of the right calf was measured with a measuring tape.

2.4.6. WHOQOL-BREF Taiwan Version

The patients were asked to fill in their own quality of life status for the previous
2 weeks in the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire brief version



Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 15009 5 of 12

(WHOQOL-BREF). The scoring of this questionnaire is based on a Likert five-point scale
(scores of five and one indicating the highest and lowest points, respectively). The score
was calculated by determining the average value for each question in the same domain
and multiplying the value by four. The total score (based on the formula) was converted to
a range of 0–20 points, with higher scores indicating better quality of life.

2.5. Statistical Analysis

A priori sample size estimation was based on anticipated differences in grip strength
of the patients with possible sarcopenia as the primary outcome based on an estimated large
effect size (0.8) between the pretest and post-training measurements [19]. The calculation
was also based on an alpha level of 0.05 and a desired statistical power of 80% using
G*Power. The estimated minimum sample size was 18 patients per group. Assuming
a dropout rate of 10%, we thus enrolled 20 patients in each group.

Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS statistical software package (version
20.0; IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA). All data values are represented as the mean and
standard deviation. The Shapiro–Wilk method was used to test whether the data were
normally distributed, and the homogeneity of the two groups was confirmed by Levene’s
test. The chi-squared test was used to analyze differences in gender and drug use between
the two groups. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to test the main effect
of time and group, and a significant group × time interaction. The paired t-test was used
to examine the differences in every testing parameter before and after training (time) in
each group. The significance level was set at p < 0.05.

3. Results
3.1. Flow of Participants

A total of 218 patients diagnosed with T2DM with possible sarcopenia were recruited
for the study. Of these, 178 patients who did not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded.
The remaining 40 eligible patients were randomly assigned to the resistance training and
control groups. Three patients were excluded later due to personal reasons or missed
visits to the hospital. Finally, 37 patients completed the entire experiment (19 and 18 in
the resistance training and control groups, respectively) (Figure 2). The adherence rate of
patients who participated in the intervention in the training group was 82%. There were no
significant differences in demographic characteristics, history of diabetes, HbA1c, blood fat,
and medication use between the two groups (p > 0.05) (Table 1). In addition, none of the
participants experienced exercise injury during the intervention.

For the HbA1c levels, the main effects changed significantly over time within (p = 0.037)
and between the groups (p = 0.042). A significant interaction between time and group
(p = 0.004) was also observed. After 12 weeks of intervention, the HbA1c levels were de-
creased significantly in both groups (p < 0.001 (training); p = 0.045 (control)); nevertheless,
the training group showed a more significant improvement in HbA1c than the control
group (Table 2).

respectively), between groups (p = 0.078, 0.370, and 0.595, respectively), or in time-by-group
interaction (p = 0.354, 0.072, and 0.172, respectively) (Table 2).

3.4. Effect of Intervention on Grip Strength

For the grip strength, the main effects were statistically significant over time within
the group (p = 0.001). The grip strengths were decreased significantly in both groups
(p < 0.001(training); p = 0.021(control)). There were no significant differences found between
groups (p = 0.520) or for the time-by-group interaction (p = 0.097) (Table 2).

3.5. Effect of Intervention on the Five Times Sit-to-Stand Test

Performance in the five times sit-to-stand test showed a statistically significant effect
in time-by-group interaction (p = 0.001). However, statistical significance was not reached
for the main effects over time within (p = 0.061) or between (p = 0.499) groups. The test
time for the training group decreased with time, whereas that for the control group tended
to increase (Table 2).

3.6. Effect of Intervention on ASM and ASMI

For ASM and ASMI, the main effects were statistically significant over time within
groups (p = 0.009 and 0.041, respectively) and for the time-by-group interaction (p = 0.001 and
0.001, respectively). However, statistical significance was not reached for the main effects over
time between groups (p = 0.795 and 0.235, respectively). After 12 weeks, the ASM and ASMI
increased over time in the training group (p = 0.023 and 0.033, respectively) but decreased in
the control group (p = 0.022 and 0.025, respectively) (Table 2).

3.7. Effect of Intervention on Calf Circumference

For the calf circumference, there was a statistically significant effect in terms of time-by-
group interaction (p = 0.010). However, statistical significance was not reached for the main
effects over time within (p = 108) or between (p = 0.223) groups. The calf circumference in
the training group increased with time (p < 0.001), while that in the control group tended to
decrease (p = 0.069) (Table 2).

3.8. Effect of Intervention on the WHOQOL Scale

Scoring on the WHOQOL scale in the physical domain showed a statistically signifi-
cant effect in terms of time-by-group interaction (p = 0.090) (Table 3). However, statistical
significance was not reached for the main effects over time within (p = 0.921) or between
(p = 0.371) groups. In the general health, psychological, environmental, and social relation-
ships domains, statistical significance was not reached for the main effects over time within
groups (p = 0.953, 0.509, 0.787, and 0.927, respectively) or between groups (p = 0.703, 0.957,
0.582, and 0.631, respectively), or time-by-group interaction (p = 0.304, 0.354, 0.540, and
0.167, respectively). Twelve weeks of training resulted in an increase in physical domain
scores (p = 0.003); however, the intervention did not lead to significant change in the control
group (p = 0.222).

4. Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study on the effect of low-intensity resis-
tance exercise training at home in patients with T2DM combined with possible sarcopenia.
Compared with patients in the control group, those in the training group had more signif-
icantly improved blood biochemical results (HbA1c) and better conditions (time*group
interaction) in muscle strength and physical performance (five times sit-to-stand test), limb
muscle mass, calf circumference, and quality of life. Exercise compliance in the training
group was 82% throughout the experimental period and was higher than reported in
previous studies [20].

Previous investigations have shown that aerobic exercise was more effective than
resistance exercise in controlling blood sugar [7,8]. Currently, few studies have exam-
ined the effects of intervention with progressive low-weight-bearing resistance exercise
in patients with T2DM. These studies reported a decrease in the average HbA1c levels
by 0.3–0.5% [10,21,22]; these results are similar to the present findings. Currently, the
mechanism through which patients with diabetes can achieve blood sugar control through
resistance exercise remains unclear. However, it is likely that the increase of glucose
transporter type 4 (GLUT4) enhances the ability of insulin transport and improves IR [23].

Consistent with previous results, the present study did not demonstrate statistically
significant differences in terms of time and group effects for HDL, LDL, and triglyc-
erides, [7,22]. Previous studies suggested that weekly exercise must exceed a caloric
cost of 1200–2200 kcal to exert a significant effect on blood lipids; in the present study, the
limited exercise may be the main reason for the lack of effect [24–26]. Moreover, 95% of the
patients in this study were receiving treatment with blood lipid-lowering drugs. Under this
condition, the HDL and LDL levels of the two groups prior to this study had reached the
standard value recommended by the American Diabetes Association (HDL ≥ 50 mg/dL,
LDL < 100 mg/dL, triglycerides < 150 mg/dL); this may be the cause for the observed
limited improvement in cholesterol levels after training.

For older adults, resistance training can reverse the negative effects of aging and is
key to maintaining strength. The re-recruitment of muscle fibers through training increases
their volume to generate more force [27]. Studies have shown that, in older adults who
have never received previous resistance training, both skeletal muscles and neuromuscular
systems exhibit significant adaptability and plasticity in response to strength training [28].
None of the patients recruited in the present study had received resistance training prior
to their participation. After 12 weeks of sandbag training, the grip strength of patients
increased by 3.2 kg, and the required five times sit-to-stand test duration was shortened by
3.2 s. Therefore, based on the results of this study, resistance training with low intensity
may increase muscle strength and physical performance in the elderly [29–32].

A Cochrane meta-analysis concluded that progressive resistance training is an effective
interventional strategy for improving physical performance in older adults, with benefits
including increased muscle strength and muscle mass [33]. In this study, 12 weeks of
progressive sandbag resistance training was applied. Although the load was relatively
light, the skeletal muscle mass of the limbs in the training group increased by 0.3 kg, which
was also similar to the results of a previous study [17,19,23,34]. It can thus be concluded
that the cross-sectional area of type II muscle fibers can be increased through low-intensity
and high-repetition exercise [35]. The calf circumference of the training group in this study
increased from 30.4 cm to 31.1 cm (an increase of 0.7 cm). According to a study conducted by
Yang, low resistance training exerted a positive effect on calf circumference and limb muscle
mass [36]. Nonetheless, studies conducted in Japan and Korea yielded different results,
which may be due to differences in gender, environment, ethnicity, genetics, lifestyle, diet,
iliac structure, fat distribution, and skin wrinkling due to disease [37,38].

The pathogenesis of T2DM increases the rate of muscle strength and muscle mass
loss, resulting in a decrease in physical activity. It has been shown that resistance training
improves quality of life, such as overall mood, sleep quality, increased vitality, and self-
efficacy. Moreover, Pourgathi showed that resistance training improved the quality of life of
elderly individuals through an increase in muscle strength and muscle mass [16]. Therefore,
the elderly can be encouraged to add progressive resistance exercise to their usual exercise
according to their ability and maintain their daily independence [12,34,35]. However, we
found no significant difference before and after tests in both groups in the general health,
psychological, social relationship, and environmental domains. This lack of effect may be
related to the distress, psychological pressure, frustration, and powerlessness caused by
diabetes. The results of the quality of life questionnaires for patients with T2DM may also
vary greatly depending on the treatment modality, the presence or absence of comorbidities
and complications, the length of the disease period, and basic demographic variables.

This study has a number of limitations. Firstly, all included patients were elderly and
most resided far away from the hospital, making it difficult for them to frequently return
to the hospital for assessment. Therefore, the exercise status of the patients could only be
tracked through telephone interviews and communication software. Secondly, exercise
compliance may not actually reflect the patient’s exercise status at home. The diet and
lifestyle of patients with diabetes have a great impact on physiological parameters, such as
blood sugar and lipid levels, but in this study, the diet of the patients was not controlled.
It is suggested that future studies make use of cooperation with dietitians to control the



Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 15009 10 of 12

diet of patients. Finally, the measurement of biochemical parameters may be affected by
the type of drugs used by the patient (e.g., diuretics, excretion and hypoglycemic drugs,
and others), which were not controlled in this study.

5. Conclusions

In this study, patients with T2DM and possible sarcopenia (age > 50 years) performed
12 weeks of home-based progressive quantitative sandbag resistance exercise training for
progressive upper and lower limb muscle strength using low-load quantitative sandbags.
Although all subjects’ medication status did not change after 12 weeks of training, the resis-
tance exercise training improved the levels of HbA1c, upper extremity strength, and muscle
mass, and had better sit-to-stand performance and quality of life than the control group.

During this study, there were no safety concerns with regard to exercise (e.g., hypo-
glycemia, falls). Therefore, this approach can be used for elderly diabetic patients with
poor physical fitness to increase muscle strength. The designed exercise methods can be
easily performed at home, the equipment is easy to use, telephone interviews or commu-
nication software can be utilized to provide continuous care, and the training method is
cost-effective. This approach provides a new option for the elderly to exercise at home
during the current COVID-19 pandemic.
