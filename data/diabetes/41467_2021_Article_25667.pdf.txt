Type 2 diabetes can be treated, and sometimes reversed, with dietary interventions; however,

strategies to implement these interventions while addressing medication changes are lacking.

We conducted a 12-week pragmatic, community-based parallel-group randomized controlled

trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03181165) evaluating the effect of a low-carbohydrate (<50 g),

energy-restricted diet (~850-1100 kcal/day; Pharm-TCR; n= 98) compared to treatment-as-

usual (TAU; n= 90), delivered by community pharmacists, on glucose-lowering medication

use, cardiometabolic health, and health-related quality of life. The Pharm-TCR intervention

was effective in reducing the need for glucose-lowering medications through complete dis-

continuation of medications (35.7%; n= 35 vs. 0%; n= 0 in TAU; p < 0.0001) and reduced

medication effect score compared to TAU. These reductions occurred concurrently with

clinically meaningful improvements in hemoglobin A1C, anthropometrics, blood pressure, and

triglycerides (all p < 0.0001). These data indicate community pharmacists are a viable and

innovative option for implementing short-term nutritional interventions for people with type 2

diabetes, particularly when medication management is a safety concern.

Type 2 diabetes is typically considered a chronic progressive
disease, but it is now established that reversal/remission of
type 2 diabetes is possible. Targeted nutritional approaches

have garnered attention due to the increasing evidence base
suggesting they can be used to induce type 2 diabetes reversal/
remission1–3. In a non-randomized trial, continuous remote-care
using a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat, ketogenic diet led to
substantial weight loss, lowered haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c), and
reduced need for glucose-lowering medications (including insu-
lin) in a diverse group of 262 patients with type 2 diabetes4–6. In a
cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT), Lean and colleagues7

showed that a 12-week very low-calorie (~850 kcal day) total diet
replacement method followed by food reintroduction resulted in
remission of type 2 diabetes (sub-diabetes HbA1c and taking no
glucose-lowering medications) in 46% of newly diagnosed
patients at one-year follow-up. Online self-management inter-
ventions also report reduced oral diabetes medications and
insulin dose, while lowering HbA1c, in participants with type 2
diabetes8. The idea that diet therapy could reduce or eliminate the
need for glucose-lowering medications is intriguing but raises
several important issues in diabetes care, including (1) how to
limit the risk of hypoglycemia due to contemporaneous over-
medication; and (2) the lack of guidance and/or knowledge of
how to safely manage medication reductions when patients follow
very low-carbohydrate or low-calorie diets.

While physicians are typically at the centre of diabetes care,
pharmacists are more accessible and patients with type 2 diabetes
make more annual visits to their pharmacist than primary care
physician; this is especially true in rural areas9. Community
pharmacists have expertise in medication management and can
serve an important role in overall diabetes management10. Due to
the need to reduce or eliminate glucose-lowering medications
when type 2 diabetes patients follow a very low-carbohydrate or
low-calorie diet4,7,11, community pharmacists may be ideally
positioned to safely and effectively deliver nutrition interventions
targeted at reducing diabetes medication use and promoting type
2 diabetes remission. Accordingly, the aim of the Pharmacist-led
therapeutic carbohydrate restriction (Pharm-TCR) as a treatment
strategy for type 2 diabetes trial12 was to determine if a very low-
carbohydrate, low-calorie diet - led by community pharmacists -
could reduce the need for glucose-lowering medications and
facilitate improvements in cardiometabolic health when com-
pared to guideline-based treatment-as-usual (TAU).

Results
Baseline characteristics of study participants. Between July 7th,
2017 and April 1st, 2019, we recruited 188 individuals from 12
pharmacies across southern British Columbia, Canada. Sample
size fell just short of the target recruitment of 100 per group; 98
participants randomized to the Pharm-TCR group and 90 par-
ticipants randomized to the TAU group comprised the intention-
to-treat population. Four participants in the Pharm-TCR group
and 15 participants in the TAU group dropped out prior to
commencing the trial. Furthermore, 16 participants in the
Pharm-TCR group and 15 participants in the TAU group drop-
ped out after commencing the trial. Sex assignment was missing
for 13 participants. The CONSORT Flow Diagram is shown in
Fig. 1. Baseline participant characteristics are reported in Table 1.

Pharm-TCR led to greater discontinuation and reduction of
glucose-lowering medication use. At 12-weeks, 35.7% of parti-
cipants in the Pharm-TCR group were completely off all glucose-
lowering medications compared to 0% in the TAU group
(absolute difference= 35.7%, 95% CI 25.9–44.8%, p < 0.0001).
Within the Pharm-TCR group, 17.3% of participants achieved an

HbA1c of <6.5% (i.e., below the diagnostic threshold for diabetes
diagnosis) and were not taking any glucose-lowering medications
compared to 0% in the TAU group (absolute difference= 17.3%,
95% CI 9.7–24.7%, p < 0.0001). Exploratory subgroup analyses for
the primary endpoint of no medications by sex and insulin user
status are presented in Supplementary Table 1. Changes in
glucose-lowering medications and blood pressure-lowering
medications, separated by medication class, are displayed in
Supplementary Tables 3 and 4, respectively. To complement the
binary primary outcome, the Pharm-TCR group had a lower
mean medication effect score (MES) at 12 weeks (p < 0.0001;
Table 2). Weekly MES in the Pharm-TCR group is displayed in
Fig. 2.

Pharm-TCR led to improvements in cardiometabolic health,
anthropometrics, and health-related quality of life (HrQL).
Secondary outcomes are reported in Table 2. Among clinical
blood markers, HbA1c, fasting glucose, triglycerides, and GGT at
12 weeks were all lower in the Pharm-TCR versus TAU group (all
p < 0.0001). Mean body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist
circumference, body fat percentage, and systolic and diastolic
blood pressure were also lower at 12 weeks in the Pharm-TCR
group when compared to TAU (all p < 0.0001). For HrQL,
measures of role functioning, mental health, health percep-
tions (p < 0.0001), and pain all improved in the Pharm-TCR
group versus TAU. Descriptive outcomes assessed weekly in the
Pharm-TCR group are displayed in Fig. 2. Mean daily macro-
nutrient and kilocalorie intake at baseline, week 6, and week 12
are reported in Supplementary Table 5.

The exploratory statistical mediation analysis for the HbA1c
(%) outcome revealed an indirect treatment effect (mediated via
the change in body mass) of −0.8 (95% confidence interval: −1.3
to −0.3) percentage points (P= 0.001). This mediation effect
represents 57% of the total causal effect of −1.4 percentage points
(Table 2). The direct effect (not mediated by the change in body
mass) was −0.6 (−1.2 to −0.04) percentage points (P= 0.037).

Adverse events. There were four adverse events reported in the
Pharm-TCR group and no adverse events reported in the TAU
group. Two of the adverse events were related to mild hypogly-
cemic events (recorded blood glucose levels of 4.1 mmol/L and
3.5 mmol/L); both events occurred when participants were
reluctant to reduce insulin dosages by the recommended amount
(one at the instruction of their endocrinologist) and were treated
by the participants by consuming carbohydrates upon the advice
of their pharmacist. Upon following the recommended medica-
tion adjustments, these participants reported no more hypogly-
cemic symptoms. One adverse event was related to reporting
hypoglycemic symptoms; however, the participant recorded
blood glucose values no lower than 5.2 mmol/L. The cause of
these symptoms was suggested to be due to waiting too long
between meals. Upon resolution of this issue, all hypoglycemic
symptoms stopped. The final adverse event was a cardiac event
that occurred three weeks into the study and was deemed not
related to the intervention by the data and safety
monitoring board.

Discussion
There is mounting evidence that type 2 diabetes can be reversed
through nutritional interventions. What must be considered now
is how people with type 2 diabetes can access efficacious inter-
ventions and how healthcare practitioners can safely deploy them.
This study provides RCT level evidence that community-based
pharmacists can effectively and safely implement a dietary
intervention that rapidly reduces the need for glucose-lowering

medications and improves cardiometabolic health in people with
type 2 diabetes within a real-world setting.

When treating type 2 diabetes, standard clinical practice is to
target glucose control and key risk factors that are associated with
the development of micro- and macrovascular disease13. Cardi-
ovascular disease accounts for ~33–50% of all diabetes-related
deaths14. In this study, we demonstrate rapid improvements in
glycemic control (while glucose-lowering medications were
withdrawn or reduced), body weight, waist circumference, tri-
glycerides, and blood pressure following the Pharm-TCR inter-
vention. Furthermore, we report a significant reduction in GGT
levels, which is correlated to reductions in excess liver fat15. Given

that excess liver fat is linked with liver insulin resistance15, and
therefore elevated fasting glucose levels, it is unsurprising that
fasting glucose was substantially reduced in the Pharm-TCR
group. Taken together, these data could indicate a depletion of
harmful liver fat and a shift toward improved overall metabolic
control. Interestingly, the sizeable reductions in blood pressure
occurred despite reduced blood pressure medication usage in the
Pharm-TCR group. The systolic blood pressure reductions in the
Pharm-TCR group equate to a ~25% reduction in total cardio-
vascular mortality risk16. Post-intervention Pharm-TCR trigly-
ceride levels and the reductions in body weight and waist
circumference have also been linked to meaningful reductions in

cardiovascular risk17–19. When combined with the significant
reductions in glycemia, the Pharm-TCR intervention elicited
widespread improvements that would be expected to markedly
reduce the risk for both micro- and macrovascular diseases.
Several HrQL variables also improved following the Pharm-TCR
intervention, providing evidence of the enhanced quality of life.
Collectively, these broad health improvements indicate that the
Pharm-TCR intervention is treating the disease rather than just
managing the resulting hyperglycemia. If these improvements are
sustained over time, a reduction in risk for common co-
morbidities of type 2 diabetes would be expected.

Medication changes in clinical trials of similar nutritional
interventions (i.e., combined low-carbohydrate, energy-restricted
diets) in type 2 diabetes are often not reported in great detail;
however, Goday et al.20 and Morris et al.21 do report a reduction
in medication use as descriptive or exploratory outcomes. The
cardiometabolic health improvements observed in our trial are in
line with reductions in HbA1c, weight loss, and changes in lipids
in studies led by primary care nurses21 and physicians20. Taken
together, our findings suggest similar efficacy for treatment out-
comes in low-carbohydrate, energy-restricted nutritional inter-
ventions implemented in community pharmacies.

The exploratory statistical mediation analysis for the HbA1c
outcome showed that over half of the total mean treatment effect
was mediated by the change in body mass. Gummesson et al.22

reported a linear ‘dose-dependent’ relationship between weight

loss and HbA1c reduction, with an estimated mean HbA1c
reduction of 0.1 percentage points for each 1 kg of weight loss. In
the current trial, the mean weight loss was approximately 12 kg,
which suggests a mean reduction in HbA1c of around 1.2 per-
centage points - close to our observed point estimate of 1.4
percentage points. Nevertheless, only 57% of the mean reduction
in HbA1c was mediated by weight loss in our trial. The direct
effect of the intervention (not mediated by weight loss) could be
due, in part, to carbohydrate restriction per se23 although other
aspects of glucoregulation (e.g., insulin sensitivity, beta-cell
function) could be involved.

A specific strength of this study was the use of pharmacists to
deliver the nutritional intervention in the community. The need
for rapid medication adjustments (i.e., within days/weeks to avoid
predictable medication-related events) when following a low-
carbohydrate, low-calorie diet necessitates that someone knowl-
edgeable in both type 2 diabetes and medication management has
frequent and direct contact with participants. Given the risk of
hypoglycemia and hypotension in this scenario, as well as the
frequent visits that people with type 2 diabetes typically make to
their local pharmacy9, community pharmacists were uniquely
positioned to fill this role. Although the intention was not for
pharmacists to replace dietitians in delivering nutrition therapy,
they were a suitable choice given the commercial weight loss plan
that was selected to standardize the delivery of the nutritional
intervention. This study highlights the potential of pharmacists in
a multidisciplinary health team strategy that includes nutrition
therapy. Given the current burden on primary care physicians in
many countries, the lack of access to registered dietitians, and the
fact that people with diabetes typically make 50% more visits to
their pharmacists than their primary care physicians9, future
studies should investigate how a pharmacist-supported care
model can be more broadly implemented.

Recently, studies have reported type 2 diabetes remission as an
outcome6,24; however, the criteria used to define remission are
often inconsistent between studies25. The American Diabetes
Association26 has previously suggested criteria for type 2 diabetes
remission that was based primarily on the results of bariatric
surgery studies. These criteria include the important caveat that
remission of diabetes must demonstrate sustained improvements
in glycemia in the absence of medications or ongoing therapy for
at least one year. While a group of participants in this study did
achieve normoglycemia while not taking glucose-lowering med-
ications, the study’s relatively short duration precludes defining
this as type 2 diabetes remission. Recently, Taylor27 used the term
post-diabetes to describe individuals who had achieved sub-type 2
diabetes glycemic levels and ceased using glucose-lowering
medications. This is fitting as it implies the person is no longer
in a state of type 2 diabetes but may be at increased risk to
redevelop type 2 diabetes due to potentially irreversible patho-
physiological alterations that may have already occurred. The
terms remission and reversal both imply that the pathophysio-
logical alterations contributing to type 2 diabetes (i.e., beta-cell
dysfunction and insulin resistance) have improved. Consequently,
without directly measuring these parameters it would be impos-
sible to use these terms. For this reason, we have chosen not to
use these terms to describe our results. Whether the numerous
beneficial improvements in cardiometabolic health observed with
the Pharm-TCR intervention constitute type 2 diabetes reversal,
type 2 diabetes remission, or classification of post-diabetes will
require further study.

Although relatively short-term in duration, there are specific
strengths of the study that should be highlighted. The trial was
designed to be pragmatic in nature to allow for insights that could
be beneficial for the implementation of similar interventions in
the community. As such, having community pharmacists deliver

the intervention in an RCT design is a major strength of the
study. Furthermore, using a standardized medication depre-
scription plan allowed for consistent implementation of the
Pharm-TCR intervention in a safe and scalable manner.

Whilst not unexpected, participant attrition was a limitation to
this study. Regardless, we treated dropouts in both groups as not
achieving the primary outcome, so we feel the estimate of the
effect of the intervention is robust. Furthermore, exploratory
subgroup analyses suggested that the mean effect of the inter-
vention was not substantially different between men and women,
or insulin users versus non-users. However, we caution that
confidence intervals for these sub-group effects are wide, as the
trial was not powered for sub-group interactions. Finally, for
continuous secondary outcomes we utilized a constrained base-
line longitudinal analysis via a linear mixed model28. When there
are no missing data, this model is equivalent to a standard
regression model with baseline included as a covariate
(ANCOVA). With missing data, the constrained baseline model
is superior, as all participants with at least one measurement
(baseline or post-intervention) are included in the analysis, given
that baseline is part of the outcome vector. Thus, while we do not
believe that the loss to follow-up negatively impacted the
robustness of our results, we acknowledge that the attrition rate
indicates that this type of intensive intervention delivered in
the community, even while closely supported, might not be sui-
table for everyone.

Although this trial was designed to compare the Pharm-TCR
intervention to usual care (i.e., TAU), some aspects of the design
should be emphasized to ensure proper interpretation of the
findings. The Pharm-TCR intervention was given to participants
free of charge. It is possible that this could impact the translation
of the results. Furthermore, although a comparison of cost-

savings via medication use reduction vs. the cost to implement
the intervention is an important question to be answered in
future research, this study was not designed for cost-effectiveness
analysis. Participants in the Pharm-TCR intervention also
received more contact with the study personnel than participants
in the TAU group. As the trial design was pragmatic in nature,
the aim was to compare the Pharm-TCR intervention (which
includes both the diet aspect and the increased monitoring) to
usual care. As such, the outcomes in the Pharm-TCR group
cannot be attributed entirely to the effects of the diet alone.

For a patient with type 2 diabetes, undertaking an impactful
dietary change can be potentially dangerous if not properly
informed and/or monitored by qualified healthcare personnel.
The results of this study suggest that pharmacists can fill this role
and can help to safely deprescribe glucose-lowering medications.
Future research should investigate the durability of the cardio-
metabolic improvements observed and explore ways to optimize
the delivery of therapeutic nutrition by incorporating community
pharmacists into type 2 diabetes care teams.

The community pharmacist-led therapeutic carbohydrate- and
energy-restricted dietary intervention effectively improved car-
diometabolic health outcomes while safely reducing or eliminat-
ing glucose-lowering medications in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Pharmacists could be viewed as an accessible and innovative
option for implementing community-based and nutritional
interventions for people with type 2 diabetes.

Methods
Study design and participants. A pragmatic community-based RCT following a
parallel-group design was conducted through 12 community pharmacies (inde-
pendently owned within the same pharmacy banner) throughout southern British
Columbia, Canada. Ethics approval was granted by UBC Clinical Research Ethics
Board (H16-01539) and written informed consent was obtained from all study

participants prior to enrollment. Study conduct was performed in accordance with
the ethical principles outlined in the World Medical Association Declaration of
Helsinki. The trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03181165) on June
8th, 2017 and the protocol detailing participant recruitment, study conduct, and
planned data analyses is published elsewhere12.

Randomization and blinding. Participants were randomized to either the phar-
macist-led, therapeutic carbohydrate-restricted or treatment-as-usual control
groups for 12 weeks. Randomization was performed by the pharmacist at each site
through a secure password-protected website maintained by the Centre for Health
Evaluation and Outcome Sciences (CHEOS). Random allocation was stratified by
site (pharmacy) and glucose-lowering medications (≤2 vs. ≥3 or taking exogenous
insulin) and performed on a 1:1 ratio using variable permuted block sizes.

Allocation lists were prepared using computer generation at CHEOS by a statis-
tician unassociated with the study. Due to the nature of the trial, it was not possible
to blind participants, study personnel at pharmacies, or research assistants to group
allocation. The statistical analysis was also performed unblinded.

Participant inclusion criteria were: the ability to provide written informed
consent, age 30–75 years, type 2 diabetes diagnosis by a physician, using at least
one glucose-lowering medication, and a body mass index of ≥30 kg m2. Exclusion
criteria included: history of a heart attack in the last two years; current unstable
cardiovascular disorder; history of liver disease, kidney disease, or impaired renal
function; currently pregnant, lactating, or planning to become pregnant within the
next 12 months; diagnosed neurological disorder; history of bariatric surgery;
history of cancer within the last five years; or dietary restrictions that would inhibit
adherence to the intervention diet.

Fig. 2 Descriptive analysis of weekly data collected in the Pharm-TCR group. Data are weekly effect estimates for changes from baseline (Week 0; gray
line) with confidence intervals in the Pharm-TCR group for (a) medication effect score (MES); (b) body mass index; (c) waist circumference; (d) body fat
percentage; (e) systolic blood pressure; and (f) diastolic blood pressure. Values are effect estimates for adjusted mean change from baseline in a–f. Bias-
adjusted and accelerated confidence intervals derived from non-parametric bootstrap analysis are presented in panel a. Error bars for panels b–f represent
95% confidence intervals. Data are based on participants for which baseline data were collected (n= 92) except for waist circumference (n= 90) and
body fat percentage (n= 91). Source data are provided as a source data file.

Study procedures. Potentially eligible participants were invited to the nearest
participating pharmacy to review the eligibility criteria and study consent form.
Recruitment was performed via a combination of newspaper and online adver-
tising, posters posted in pharmacies, and word of mouth in each respective study
site location. Prior to any data collection, written informed consent was obtained
and participants’ primary care physicians were notified of their participation. Upon
admittance, eligible participants underwent baseline assessment of medication use,
anthropometrics, blood pressure, and completed study questionnaires measuring
HrQL and habitual physical activity (Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire)
at the pharmacy. A fasting blood sample was obtained by a local laboratory and
participants completed a 3-day diet record to assess habitual food intake.

Participants in the Pharm-TCR group were asked to follow a commercial weight
loss diet plan (Ideal Protein) supplemented with whole foods. The diet plan was
provided free-of-charge and utilized a variety of low-carbohydrate, energy-restricted,
adequate-protein meals and snacks that were used in combination with select meats
and vegetables. Based on individualized food choices selected from within the diet plan,
the daily macronutrient content equated to <50 g carbohydrates, ~35–45 g fat, and
~110–120 g protein for a total of ~850–1100 kcal. Participants in the Pharm-TCR
group had weekly visits to the pharmacy to meet with a lifestyle coach and pharmacist
to monitor progress, collect intervention foods, and assess medication usage. Lifestyle
coaches managed scheduling and administrative tasks and were responsible for
collecting anthropometric and blood pressure data while the pharmacists were
responsible for all disease and medication data collection, information, and decisions.
The medication deprescription plan is outlined in the supplementary information of
the published protocol paper12 (https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/
10.1186/s13063-019-3873-7#Sec18). Data collected at weekly visits included: weight,
height (visit 1 only), BMI, waist circumference, body fat % (bioelectrical impedance
analysis), blood pressure, capillary blood ketones, and medication usage. On week 6 of
the diet, participants completed another 3-day diet record. On the final visit, in addition
to the typical weekly assessments, participants were assessed for the same blood, HrQL,
diet record, and habitual physical activity measures that were collected at baseline.

Participants in the TAU group were given standard medication advice by their
pharmacist as well as information pamphlets on diet and lifestyle conforming with
2013 Diabetes Canada (formerly the Canadian Diabetes Association) Clinical
Practice Guidelines. Participants in the TAU group did not attend weekly meetings
during the 12-week control period; however, they completed a 3-day diet record on
week 6, similar to the Pharm-TCR group. Following the 12-week period, TAU
participants returned to the pharmacy where they were assessed for the same
blood, anthropometrics, HrQL, diet record, and habitual physical activity measures
that were collected at baseline. Participants allocated to the TAU group were given
the option of receiving the Pharm-TCR intervention after their initial 12-week
TAU period in an effort to retain participants.

Outcome measures. The primary outcome measure was a binary outcome of either
using or not using glucose-lowering medications after the 12-week study period. Sec-
ondary outcomes assessed at baseline and 12 weeks included HbA1c, change in glucose-
lowering medication dose, BMI, body weight, waist circumference, body fat percentage,
HrQL, blood lipid profile (total, HDL & LDL cholesterol, triglycerides), liver function
tests (ALT, AST, and GGT), fasting plasma glucose, blood pressure, change in blood
pressure medication dose, and a binary outcome of achieving both HbA1c <6.5% and
no glucose-lowering medication use. Body weight and body fat percentage were assessed
using the Tanita model DF-430 U (IL, USA), blood pressure was assessed using the
PharmaSmart Model PS-2000C (BC, Canada), height was measured using the Seca
model 700 (Germany), and waist circumference was assessed by measuring the distance
around the waist at the top of the iliac crest with a tape measure. HbA1c, fasting plasma
glucose, blood lipid profile, and liver function tests were analyzed by provincially
accredited laboratories per standard clinical practice. The leisure score index was cal-
culated by multiplying the number of strenuous, moderate, and mild bouts of physical
activity by 9, 5, and 2, respectively29. HrQL was assessed using the 20-item Medical
Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-20) and analyzed as described in Stewart et al.30.
Medication effect score was calculated31 as a continuous secondary outcome to quantify
changes in medication use that were not captured by the primary outcome. Briefly,
MES reflects the overall intensity of a diabetes medication regimen and is based on
medication dosages and their efficacy for reducing blood glucose. Secondary outcomes
assessed during the weekly visits in the Pharm-TCR group were MES, BMI, waist
circumference, body fat percentage, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure.
Descriptive data for macronutrient content and energy intake from the 3-day food
records were analyzed with MyFitnessPal (Under Armour®, Inc.).

Statistical analysis. All analyses were performed using R32 and Stata software33.
Data were analyzed as randomized. For the primary outcome, any participants lost to
follow-up were presumed to be still using glucose-lowering medications. In Stata
software, we applied a generalised linear model with a binomial distribution and logit
link, with the Huber/White/sandwich variance estimator. To permit convergence,
given zero events in the TAU arm, we specified the ‘asis’ command. The difference in
proportion (Pharm-TCR vs. TAU) achieving ‘no medications’ and its asymmetric 95%
confidence interval was derived using the -regpar- program34. The binary secondary
outcome (both HbA1c <6.5% and ‘no medications’) was analysed with the same
model. Exploratory subgroup analyses by sex and insulin user (yes/ no) were con-
ducted by specifying a subgroup*treatment interaction. The exploratory subgroup

analyses for the primary outcome and the secondary outcomes of continuous HbA1c
and body weight (by sex) are included in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2.

For the continuous secondary outcomes, missing data were assumed to be
missing at random. Data were analyzed using constrained baseline longitudinal
analysis via a linear mixed model28, which allows all participants with at least one
measurement (baseline or post-intervention) to be included in the analysis as a
baseline is part of the outcome vector. The lme4 package35 was used specifying
Satterthwaite degrees of freedom, with fixed effects for timepoint (Pre vs. Post 12-
weeks), treatment, sex, and the stratified allocation factors - study site and glucose-
lowering medication use [2 or less, 3 or greater or taking exogenous insulin]) - and
a random effect for participants to account for repeated measures within
participants. ‘Treatment’ is a factor coded ‘1’ if time= post and group= Pharm-
TCR and coded zero otherwise. Subgroup analysis by sex was conducted for HbA1c
and body weight by adding a sex*treatment interaction term. For descriptive
purposes, outcomes assessed at the weekly visits in the Pharm-TCR group were
analyzed using a linear mixed model with fixed effects for the week (0 to 12), sex,
and the stratification factors (as above), and a random effect for participants.

The model specification was assessed visually using normal probability plots
and residuals vs. fitted values plots. When the behaviour of the model residuals
warranted a log transformation, effect estimates and 95% confidence intervals were
back-transformed to ratio (percentage) differences using the emmeans package36.
In cases where a log transformation could not be used (e.g. due to zero values),
nonparametric bootstrap analyses were performed with 2000 resamples with
replacement, and bias-corrected and accelerated 95% confidence intervals were
calculated with the boot package37,38.

We conducted an exploratory statistical mediation analysis using the Stata -sem-
module, to examine the extent to which the observed treatment effect on HbA1c was
mediated by the change in body mass. This analysis partitions the total causal effect
into direct and indirect effects. The indirect effect is that passing through the putative
mediator (change in body mass). The indirect effect/total effect × 100 gives the
proportion (%) of the total treatment effect mediated by the change in body mass.

A sample size of approximately 100 per group was required to provide 80%
power to detect a 20% difference (odds ratio of 2.67) in the proportion of patients
on zero glucose-lowering medications (assuming 20% in TAU), with a two-sided P
value of 0.0539. Throughout, 95% confidence intervals are interpreted as the
plausible range of effect sizes compatible with the data and model.
