Previous studies have demonstrated that patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus

(T2DM) often had the problems of fecal microbiota dysbiosis, and were usually

accompanied with psychiatric comorbidities (such as depression and anxiety).

Here, we conducted a randomized clinical study to analyze the changes in gut

microbiota, serum metabolism and emotional mood of patients with T2DM after

consumption of a high-fiber diet. The glucose homeostasis of participants with

T2DM was improved by the high-fiber diet, and the serum metabolome, systemic

inflammation and psychiatric comorbidities were also altered. The increased

abundances of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Akkermansias revealed that

the proportions of beneficial gut microbes were enriched by the high-fiber diet,

while the abundances of Desulfovibrio, Klebsiella and other opportunistic

pathogens were decreased. Therefore, the current study demonstrated that the

intestinal microbiota alterations which were influenced by the high-fiber diet could

improve the serum metabolism and emotional mood of patients with T2DM.

Introduction

Accumulating studies have demonstrated that there were intimate correlations between

type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and gut microbiota. By modulating the structure of gut

microbiota, a specially designed high-fiber diet was proved to be able to provide obvious

beneficial effects for patients with T2DM (Zhao et al., 2018). In fact, the modulation of gut

microbiota could not only increase the relative abundances of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium

and other beneficial microbes, and could also improve the plasma and the fecal bile acid

metabolism of patients with T2DM (Gu et al., 2017). Metagenome-

wide association study in a cohort of young Chinese individuals

identified an obesity-associated gut microbial species (Bacteroides

thetaiotaomicron), which could alleviate diet-induced body-weight

gain and adiposity by reducing plasma glutamate concentrations (Liu

et al., 2017). These findings indicated that the intestinal microbiota

might play a critical role in treating obesity and T2DM. Several genera

of beneficial bacteria (such as Allobaculum, Bacteroides, Blautia,

Butyricoccus, and Phascolarctobacterium) with short-chain fatty

acid (SCFA)-producing properties were proved to be associated

with the prevention of obesity and insulin resistance in high-fat diet

(HFD) fed rats (Zhang et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2015). A large

structural survey of fecal microbiota in 314 healthy Chinese young

adults revealed that nine genera of bacteria (including

Phascolarctobacterium, Roseburia, Blautia, Faecalibacterium,

Clostridium, Subdoligranulum, Ruminococcus, Coprococcus and

Bacteroides) with SCFA-producing properties were certified to be

necessary for maintaining the host’s health (Zhang et al., 2015).

Therefore, many novel strategies (such as prebiotic, probiotic and

fecal microbiota transplantation) targeting the gut microbiota could

be developed for type 2 diabetes interventions.

The clinical symptoms of anxiety and depression were often

observed in patients with T2DM, and the reason might lie in that

the diabetic nutrient restrictions and the imbalanced gut microbiota

influence the patient’s emotional state (Collins et al., 2009;

Semenkovich et al., 2015). The gut microbiota could influence the

host’s central neurochemistry and change their stress responses and

cognitive behaviors, and the communications between the gut and

brain might be related to the various kinds of microbial metabolites,

including catecholamines, serotonin, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and

SCFAs (Ho & Ross, 2017). In particular, administration of SCFAs

were proved to be able to alleviate the stress-induced responsiveness

as well as the intestinal permeability, and could also influence the

brain immune homeostasis, energy metabolism, and physiological

states (Wouw et al., 2018; Valles-Colomer et al., 2019). Moreover,

functional food consumption could obviously decrease the

autoreactive T cell numbers in lymphoid tissues and decrease the

serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokines (Marino et al.,

2017). Therefore, the bidirectional communications between the gut

and brain could be influenced by nutritional interventions.

Nowadays, personalized nutritional interventions based on

transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics techniques could

provide additional benefits for patients with T2DM. Consumptions

of functional foods and bioactive ingredients could enhance the anti-

oxidant properties, the anti-inflammatory activities, the anti-

cholesterol activities, and the insulin sensitivity of patients with

T2DM (Alkhatib et al., 2017; Zhang and Gregg, 2017; Laksir et al.,

2018). The gut microbiota could transduce the nutrients signals and

retard the development of chronic inflammation and metabolic

disorders, and the administration of functional foods could also

increase the abundances of Akkermansia, Bifidobacteria,

Lactobacillus, Bacteroides and Prevotella (Shanahan et al., 2017).

When the food components of dietary fiber, polyphenols,

flavonoids, sterols, and unsaturated fatty acids were digested by the

gut microbes, various kinds of microbial metabolites were produced

to treat the obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and

T2DM (Lyu et al., 2017). By regulating the homeostasis of innate and
Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology 02
adaptive immune system, the diverse microbiota-derived bioactive

molecules could regulate the health and disease of the host (Blander

et al., 2017). Recent studies had also proved that the symbiotic

bacteria could influence the development and function of the

nervous system, which were related to anxiety, depression, and

other mental diseases (Sharon et al., 2016). In fact, most of the

neurotransmitters in the brain (such as 5-hydroxytryptamine and g-
aminobutyric acid) were produced by the gut microbes, therefore the

microbiome-gut-grain axis had a critical impact on stress responses,

depression and anxiety (Dinan and Cryan, 2017). Thus, manipulation

of functional foods towards the gut microbiota could be applied to

fight against the metabolic syndromes and the central nervous system

diseases (Barratt et al., 2017; Maier and al'Absi, 2017).

In this study, the profiles of fecal microbiota samples from

patients with T2DM altered by a high-fiber diet were studied, and

the relations between the microbial communities and the host’s

clinical features were also determined and analyzed.
Materials and methods

Subject recruitment

This study was a randomized, open-label, parallel-group clinical

trial in T2DM patients with a 4-week treatment period. The study was

performed according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki

(2008), and the study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee

of Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (ID:

SNPH2017-026). All the participants signed the informed

consent forms.

During the initial screening period, patients with plasma HbA1c

levels (6.5%-12.0%) were recruited. Patients who had taken

antibiotics, probiotics and prebiotics during the previous 3 months

were excluded. Other exclusive criteria included type 1 diabetes,

severe hepatic diseases, gastrointestinal surgery and severe mental

illness. Patients were also excluded if they had severe organic diseases,

including cancer, coronary heart disease, and cerebral apoplexy.
Study design

After a 2-week washout period, 17 patients clinically diagnosed

with T2DM enrolled in the clinical trial and were randomly assigned

into two groups using the SAS software. As an open-label, parallel-

group study, the control group (n = 8 patients) received usual care,

including patient education and dietary recommendations based on

the 2013 Chinese Diabetes Society guidelines for T2DM; the

treatment group (n = 9 patients) received whole grains, prebiotics,

and traditional Chinese medicinal foods composed high-fiber diet.

The high-fiber diet for the treatment group consisted of several whole

grains and traditional Chinese medicinal food (shown in Table 1).

The recruited participants received either acarbose (100 mg; 3

times/day) plus common diet for T2DM (control group) or acarbose

(100 mg; 3 times/day) plus the high fiber diet (treatment group) for 8

weeks, while all the patients received the same total caloric and

macronutrients prescriptions and followed the exercises advice

according to the Chinese Diabetes Society.

Anthropometric measurement
and evaluation

The assessments of fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycosylated

hemoglobin (HbA1c), serum insulin, C-peptides, triglyceride (TG), total

cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), and low-

density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) were detected before and after the

treatment. The serum levels of interleukin-1b (IL-1b), interleukin-6 (IL-6),
monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and tumor necrosis factor-a
(TNF-a) were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays

(ELISAs), respectively. The depression and anxiety symptoms of all
Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology 03
participants were evaluated by the validated questionnaires of Hamilton

Anxiety Scale (HAMA) and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD).
Fecal DNA extraction and high-
throughput sequencing

The fecal samples were collected for gut microbiota analysis

before and after the treatments. Microbial genomic DNA was

extracted using an InviMagH Stool DNA kit referred to the

previous study (Ling et al., 2016). The extracted DNA was then

verified by agarose gel electrophoresis following the manufacturer’s

instructions. The V3-4 hypervariable region of 16S rRNA genes was

amplified by PCR using the barcoded-fusion primers, and then the

PCR amplification products were separated using agarose gels (Chung

et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016; Song et al., 2017). The PCR products from

the gels without primer dimers and contaminant bands were used for

Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing by Personal

Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China.
Bioinformatics and statistical analysis

The quality control and sequence filtering of raw reads was

performed according to the barcode matching and sequence

overlapping using QIIME (version 1.9.1). The filtered high-quality

reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with a

similarity level of 97%, then the obtained OTUs were used for

taxonomical assignments by RDP classifier (Chen et al., 2019;

Ghosh et al., 2021). The microbial diversities and taxonomic

compositions of the sampled bacterial communities were

implemented using the R package software (Zhang et al., 2015).

The contributions of bacterial community genes for potential

function were predicted using PICRUSt package through the

EggNOG Database (Gao et al., 2017).
Statistical analysis

The data statistical analyses were compared using a one-way

analysis of variance (ANOVA) by the SPSS Data Analysis Program

(version 17.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) at the end of each

bioassay. All mean comparison was performed using Fisher’s least

significant difference test (LSD) with a significance level

of P < 0.05.
Results

The glucose homeostasis of participants
with T2DM was improved by the
high-fiber diet

After 8 weeks of intervention, the glucose homeostasis of the

treatment group was significantly improved by the high-fiber diet.

Compared with the control group, the HbA1c levels and FBG levels of

the treatment group decreased significantly, while the levels of serum

insulin and C-peptides of the treatment group increased significantly

(Figure 1). These results demonstrated that consumption of a

sufficient amount of fermentable fiber could provide obvious

metabolic benefits for patients with T2DM.
Changes in the serum lipid
metabolism profiles

To observe the blood lipid profiles influenced by the high-fiber diet, the

serum levels of TC, TG, LDL-C and HDL-C were measured and analyzed.

Compared with the control group, the serum concentrations of TC, TG

and LDL-C in the treatment group were decreased, while the serum levels

of HDL-C in the treatment group were increased (shown in Table 2).

These data indicated that the lipid metabolism of the participants

with T2DM was improved by the high-fiber diet, which revealed that

the added fermentable carbohydrates could produce clinically lipid

metabolic improvements in the treatment group.
Measurements of serum inflammatory
chemokines levels

Serum levels of inflammatory chemokine can be used as

indicators of systemic inflammation, in this study, four kinds of

serum inflammatory chemokines (IL-1b, IL-6, MCP-1 and TNF-a) in
the two groups were measured by ELISA detecting methods.

Compared with the control group, the serum levels of inflammatory
Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology 04
chemokines in the treatment group were significantly decreased

(Figure 2). The current results demonstrated that the consumption

of a high-fiber diet could decrease the systemic inflammation.
Evaluations of the depression and anxiety
symptom severities

The depression and anxiety symptom severities were evaluated by

HAMA and HAMD questionnaires. The scores of HAMA and

HAMD were significantly decreased in patients of the treatment

group (P <0.05), indicated that the depression and anxiety

symptoms were alleviated by the high-fiber diet (Figure 3). The

results demonstrated that significant improvement in depression

and anxiety moods were observed in the treatment group by the

uptake of more diverse carbohydrates in the diet.
Microbial compositional alterations of the
gut microbiota

The raw data obtained from the Illumina MiSeq platform were

quality-filtered and demultiplexed to remove invalid and low-quality

sequences. A total of 2170797 quality-filtered and chimera-checked

sequences were obtained from the 34 samples. The rarefaction curves

demonstrated that the sequencing depth was enough for the microbial

diversity analysis in the current study (Figure 4A). The rank

abundance curves revealed that the richness of gut microbiota in

the treatment group increased after the high-fiber diet consumption

(Figure 4B). The Venn diagram indicated that the diversity of gut

microbiota in the treatment group was also enhanced by the dietary

intervention (Figure 4C). The principal coordinate analysis (PCoA)

revealed that the different experimental groups were clustered into

different communities, which meant that the beta diversity analysis

was also changed (Figure 4D).

To assign taxonomic compositions of gut microbiota, the RDP

classifier was used to compare the bacterial community structure

shifts at the phylum level and genus level, respectively. Taxonomic

analysis revealed that a total of 15 phyla, 25 classes, 63 orders, 119

families, 307 genera, and 603 species were identified. At the phylum

level, Firmicutes and Bacteroidota account for 79.96% percentages of

the total bacterial communities (Figure 5A). In the treatment group,

the proportion of Firmicutes was decreased while the proportion of

Bacteroidota was increased. Therefore, the ratio of Firmicutes to

Bacteroidota (F/B value) was significantly decreased in the treatment

group (P<0.05). Compared with the control group, the composition of

Proteobacteria in the treatment group was decreased, indicated that

the colonic epithelial oxygenation was altered by the high-fiber diet.

In the treatment group, the proportions of several genera beneficial
Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology 05
microbes were enhanced, including Lactobacillus(0.08% vs. 4.84%),

Akkermansia (0.07% vs. 2.74%), Bifidobacterium (3.70% vs. 5.43%),

Bacteroides (12.52% vs. 16.67%), Ruminococcus (1.25% vs. 2.88%),

and Blautia (1.56% vs. 1.87%). However, the relative abundances of

Erysipelatoclostridium (1.02% vs. 0.09%), Megamonas (3.96% vs.

2.43%), Prevotella (4.04% vs. 2.40%), Klebsiella (0.65% vs. 0.25%),

Desulfovibrio (0.17% vs. 0.07%)and other opportunistic

pathogenswere decreased in the treatment group (Figures 5B, 6).

The changes in bacterial abundances at the genus level revealed that

the microbial communities were obviously improved by the high-fiber

diet. The predicted functions were calculated based on the PICRUSt

software, and a total of 22 pathways were predicted in EggNOG

(evolutionary genealogy of genes: Non-supervised Orthologous

Groups). As shown in Figure 7, microbial genes of Lipid transport

and metabolism, Inorganic ion transport and metabolism, Nucleotide

transport and metabolism, Coenzyme transport and metabolism,

Energy production and conversion, Energy production and

conversion, Amino acid transport and metabolism, and

Carbohydrate transport and metabolism were decresed in the

treatment group. However, the microbial genes of Secondary

metabolites biosynthesis and transport and catabolism were

increased. The predicted pathway changes indicated that

carbohydrate and energy metabolism were influenced by the high-

fiber diet.
Discussion

Previous studies had already proved that the gut microbiota was a

critical environmental factor for treating T2DM and other metabolic

disorders (Liu et al., 2017; C. Zhang et al., 2010). A nutritional diet

carbohydrates for the gut microbiota to ferment, and the microbial

metabolites could provide energy supply and regulate the immune

function of the host (Justin et al., 2017; Gowd et al., 2019). For

example, the SCFAs produced by gut microbiota demonstrated

obvious T2DM-alleviating effects (Dalile et al., 2019). In this study,

a specially designed high-fiber diet was applied to regulate the

composition of intestinal flora in patients with T2DM.

Zhao et al. had revealed that the gut microbiota could bring

additional health benefits for patients with T2DM through

carbohydrate fermentation and SCFA production (Zhao et al.,

2018). Consistent with the previous study, our experiment results

also proved that the high-fiber diet could improve the glucose

homeostasis of participants with T2DM. When compared with the

control group, the serum levels of HbA1c levels and FBG decreased

significantly in the treatment group, while the serum levels of insulin

and C-peptides increased significantly in the treatment group

(Figure 1). Simultaneously, the serum lipid profiles were also

improved by the high-fiber diet. The decreased the serum levels of

the TC, TG and LDL-C and the increased serum levels of HDL-C in

the treatment group indicated the lipid metabolism of participants

with T2DM was improved after consumption of a high-fiber diet

(Table 2). Therefore, the dietary source of fibers demonstrated

obvious protective impacts on glucose homeostasis and lipid

metabolism of the patients with T2DM.

Manipulation of the gut microbiota by prebiotic administration

could improve the glucose and lipid metabolism in obese and diabetic

mice, and the low-grade inflammation were also decreased (Everard

et al., 2011). Cani et al. demonstrated that prebiotic-treated ob/ob

mice exhibited a lower level of plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and

inflammatory cytokines, and the decreased inflammatory tone was

proved to be associated with a lower intestinal permeability and an

improved tight-junction integrity when compared to controls (Cani

et al., 2009). Further analysis indicated that the inulin-supplemented

diet could restore the leptin related pathways (especially AMPK

signaling pathway) of ob/ob mice, which was mediated by gut

microbiota changes (Song et al., 2019). In the current study, the

serum levels of inflammatory chemokines (IL-1b, IL-6, MCP-1 and

TNF-a) in the treatment group were significantly decreased when

compared with the control group (Figure 2). The changes in

systematic inflammation might be related to the immune regulatory

functions of fermented products of carbohydrates.

The hippocampal neuronal apoptosis and synaptic structural

damage were proved to be associated with the overexpression of

proinflammatory cytokines and overactivation of microglia and

astrocytes, therefore alterations of intestinal flora could inhibit the

immune-inflammatory response and signaling by producing SCFAs

(Shao et al., 2023). In this research, evaluations of the depression and

anxiety symptoms by HAMA and HAMD questionnaires indicated

that the depression and anxiety symptoms were improved in the

treatment group (Figure 3). Therefore, the improvements in

emotional moods were observed when more diverse carbohydrates

were consumed and the gut microbiota was altered.

Themicrobial communities of patients with T2DMwere obviously

changed after the high-fiber diet administration. The richness and

diversity of the bacterial community in the treatment group were both

enhanced (Figure 4). The phylum of Firmicutes and Bacteroidota

contributed 79.96% proportion of the gut microbes (Figure 5A).

increased and the composition of Bacteroidota decreased in the

treatment group. Therefore, the decreased ratio of F/B value revealed

that the gut microbiota in the treatment group changed obviously at

the phylum level. The dysbiotic expansion of anaerobic proteobacteria

was considered to have an intimate relation with colonic epithelial

oxygenation and intestinal inflammation. When compared with the

control group, the composition of proteobacteria decreased obviously

in the treatment group. As shown in Figures 5B, 6, several genra

of beneficial microbes with lactic acid and SCFAs producing activity

were increased after the high-fiber diet intervention, including

Lactobacillus(0.08% vs. 4.84%), Akkermansia (0.07% vs. 2.74%),

Bifidobacterium (3.70% vs. 5.43%), Bacteroides (12.52% vs. 16.67%),

Ruminococcus (1.25% vs. 2.88%), and Blautia(1.56% vs. 1.87%). At the

same time, the proportions of Erysipelatoclostridium (1.02% vs. 0.09%),

Megamonas (3.96% vs. 2.43%), Prevotella (4.04% vs. 2.40%), Klebsiella

(0.65% vs. 0.25%), Desulfovibrio (0.17% vs. 0.07%), and other

opportunistic pathogens were decreased in the treatment group.

Therefore, the optimized gut microbiota composition could help the

host to modulate immune homeostasis and protect gut barrier

function. Moreover, the predicted PICRUSt functions demonstrated

that pathways related to the carbohydrate and energy metabolism were

influenced by the high-fiber diet (Figure 7).
Conclusions

In the present study, clinical data indicated that the increased

availability of fermentable carbohydrates was sufficient to induce

metabolic improvements in patients with T2DM. The dietary

source of fibers demonstrated protective impacts on the gut

ecosystem, and the alteration of the gut microbiota composition

improved the glucose homeostasis in patients with T2DM.
