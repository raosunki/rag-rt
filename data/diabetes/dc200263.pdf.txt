Glycemic Control in Type 2
Diabetes: A Randomized
Crossover Trial
Diabetes Care 2020;43:1717–1723 | https://doi.org/10.2337/dc20-0263

OBJECTIVE

To consider the effects of whole-grain processing, specifically milling, on glycemic
control in free-living adults with type 2 diabetes.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Participants of this crossover trial were randomized to two interventions of 2 weeks,
separated by washout. They were advised to replace the grain foods they normally
consumedwith intervention foods. Intervention foodswerenutrient-matchedwhole-
grain products of wheat, oats, and brown rice that differed in their degree of
processing. No other lifestyle advice was given. Continuous glucose monitoring
systems were worn. Other cardiometabolic risk factors and alkylresorcinols (a
biomarker of whole-grain intake) were measured pre- and postintervention.

RESULTS

Thirty-oneadultswith type2diabetes (63613years old, BMI32.467kg/m2,HbA1c

7.5 6 3.4% [59 6 14 mmol/mol]) commenced the trial; 28 (90%) completed both
interventions. The increase in alkylresorcinols did not differ between interventions,
and therewasnodifference in reportedenergy intake. Postprandial responseswere
9% (95% CI 3–15) lower following breakfast and 6% (1–10) lower following all meals
of less-processed whole grains when compared with finely milled grains. Day-long
glycemic variability also was reduced when measured by 24-h SD (20.16 mmol/L
[95% CI20.25 to20.06]) and mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (20.36 [95%
CI20.65 to20.08]). Mean change in body weight differed by 0.81 kg (95% CI 0.62–
1.05) between interventions, increasing during the finely milled intervention and
decreasing during the less-processed whole-grain intervention. This was not a
mediating factor for the glycemic variables considered.

CONCLUSIONS

Consuming less-processed whole-grain foods over 2 weeks improved measures of
glycemia in free-living adults with type 2 diabetes compared with an equivalent
amountofwhole-grain foods thatwerefinelymilled.Dietaryadvice shouldpromote
the consumption of minimally processed whole grains.

Diets rich in whole grains are associated
with reduced incidence of type 2 diabe-
tes, coronary heart disease, and colorec-
tal cancer (1). Randomized controlled
trials of increasing whole-grain intakes
have demonstrated their potential to
improve glycemic control, body weight,
the lipid profile, and other cardiometa-
bolic risk factors in adults with diabetes
(2). Furthermore, their production has a
lesser adverse effect on planetary health
than is the case for many other nutrient-
rich foods (3). Unsurprisingly, many
national dietary guidelines (4) and
recommendations for the management
of diabetes (5,6) encourage whole-grain
consumptionandsuggest replacingrefined
grains with whole grains.
Current definitions of the term whole

grain permit the inclusion of highly pro-
cessed and reconstituted fractions of
whole grains (7,8). Furthermore, such
finely ground products may be added
into ultraprocessed foods, the consump-
tion of which can lead to increased
calorie intake and weight gain (9). There
is evidence that the acute glycemic re-
sponse to whole-grain foods is greater
when grains have been finely milled
(10). More recently, we have shown
that the glycemic response to four dif-
ferent whole-grain wheat breads is re-
lated to thedegreeof grain processing in
adults with type 2 diabetes (11).
To date, all relevant studies have ex-

amined the acute effects of whole-grain
processing on postprandial glycemia in
controlled settings.Wehaveundertaken a
2-week randomized crossover trial in free-
living adults with type 2 diabetes to de-
termine whether the structural integrity
of whole grains as a result of differences
in milling is a determinant of overall gly-
cemic control. We provided participants
with their whole-grain foods and used
continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)
systems to assess glycemic control.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

This randomized crossover trial compared
twodietary interventions, each of 2-week
duration, separated by a washout period
of at least 2 weeks. The trial was con-
ducted between October 2018 and April
2019 in Dunedin, New Zealand. The trial
protocol was reviewed and approved by
the Health and Disability Ethics Commit-
tee of the Ministry of Health, New Zea-
land (reference18/STH/172). All participants

provided written informed consent. The
trial protocol was prospectively regis-
tered with the Australia New Zealand
Clinical Trials Registry.

Participant Eligibility Criteria
Adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes
and aged between 18 and 80 years were
eligible. Presenceof comorbidities did not
exclude participation; however, pregnancy,
lactation, or a change in medication poten-
tially influencing blood glucose control in
the past 3 months did. Participants were
recruited locally through general practices,
fliers in supermarkets, online advertise-
ments, and participation in earlier studies.

Randomization and Masking
The intervention order was determined
by a computer-generated 1:1 block ran-
domization protocol. Each intervention
order was stored in a separate opaque
envelope and accessed sequentially once
each participant provided written con-
sent. Participants were blinded to
CGM data during both interventions
and did not receive study feedback until
both interventions were complete.
The author who ran the analysis was
blinded to the interventions for the initial
comparisons. Given the nature of the
interventions, participants could not be
masked. Theywereawareof the research
question this trial sought to address, and
there were visible differences in the
foods provided.

Interventions
Given that the aim of the trial was to
examine the effect of food processing of
whole grains on glycemic control and
other cardiometabolic risk factors, we
provided participants with commonly
consumed whole-grain foods that dif-
fered in the extent of their milling. In
one intervention, participants were pro-
vided with intact oats, brown rice, and
whole-grain breadmadewith coarsely
ground flour and kibbled wheat kernels.
They were instructed to replace their
current grain intake, determined by a
preintervention 4-day diet record, with
the foods provided. In the other inter-
vention, participants were provided with
instant oats, brown rice pasta, and
whole-grain bread made with finely
milled flour, and the same instructions
to replace their current grain intake with
the foods provided. No advice was given
to change the amount of grains consumed.

No further dietary or other lifestyle ad-
vice was given. Whole-grain foods were
commercially available, were 100%
whole grain (7,8), were matched for
macronutrients and fiber, and met the
American Association of Cereal Chemists
International characterization of a whole-
grain product (12).

Before the first intervention, partici-
pants completed a 4-day semiquantita-
tive food diary to estimate their usual
intakes. Metric cups were provided to
each participant for use when weighing
scales were not available. Participants
attended the clinic on days 1, 7, and
14 during both interventions. On day 1, a
baseline fasting blood sample and an-
thropometric measurements were taken,
the intervention was explained, and par-
ticipants received their whole-grain
foods. CGM systems were fitted to the
upper arm and activated. Participants
were provided with daily checklists to re-
cord when and what intervention foods
were consumed. On day 7, participants
were provided with more intervention
foods if required and given a 4-day semi-
quantitative food diary with instructions
to capture 3weekdays and 1weekendday
in the coming week. On day 14, the in-
tervention ended, a fasting blood sample
and anthropometric measurements were
taken, and the CGM system removed.

Measurements
Anthropometric measurements (height,
weight, and body composition) were
recorded in duplicate, and resting blood
pressure was measured three times.
Participants wore a CGM system (Free-
Style Libre Pro; Abbot Laboratories) to
measure interstitial glucose every 15min
for thedurationof the interventions. This
model was blinded so that data could not
be viewed during the intervention. This
modelwas also factory calibrated anddid
not need additional calibration against
capillary bloodmeasures. Fasting plasma
samples were collected and stored at
280°C until analysis. Glycated hemoglo-
binA1c (HbA1c), cholesterol (total, LDL,and
HDL), triglycerides,C-reactiveprotein,and
a-1-acid glycoprotein were measured on
an automated analyzer (Roche Diagnos-
tics) after calibration with the appropri-
atestandards. Fasting insulinwasmeasured
with a Bio-Plex magnetic bead array (Bio-
Rad Laboratories), with concentrations cal-
culated on standard curve data using the
manufacturer’s software. Alkylresorcinols

1718 Whole-Grain Processing and Glycemia Diabetes Care Volume 43, August 2020



were measured as an objective marker of
whole-grain intake (13).
Alkylresorcinol homologs C17:0, C19:0,

and C21:0 were measured with liquid
chromatography-high-resolution mass spec-
trometry (14) and then summed. Grain
particle size for each of the foods pro-
vided in the interventions was charac-
terized by sieve analysis (15), using
12 sieves from 63 to 5,600 mm.
Theprimaryoutcome investigatedwas

a change in blood glucose control fol-
lowing meals and over the day. Post-
prandial glycemia was measured by the
blood glucose incremental area under
the curve (iAUC) with CGM data in the
3 h after breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Par-
ticipants’ fooddiaryandhabitualmealtimes
provided the initial basis for identifying
breakfast, lunch, and dinner time frames
through a hierarchical decision-making
process. Where the time of meal com-
mencementcouldnotbeestablished, the
data were excluded from the analysis.
iAUC calculations for the 2-week inter-
ventions were based on 730 breakfasts,
734 lunches, and 764 dinners. Day-long
variables were time spent in range (3.9–
10.0 mmol/L), time spent below range
(,3.9 mmol/L), time spent above range
(.10.0 mmol/L) (16), and measures of
glycemic variability. The daily measures
of glycemic variability were the SD of the
mean (16), the continuous overall net
glycemic action (17), and the mean am-
plitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE) (18).
Values of glycemic variability were cal-
culated (19). Nutrition information was
obtained from manufacturers. Dietary
data were analyzed with FoodWorks
9 (Xyris Software) using the New Zealand
FOODfiles 2016, supplemented by Aus-
Foods 2017.

Statistical Analysis
The sample size estimate was based
on a power calculationwith anaof 0.05
and power of 0.80 to detect within-
group differences in primary outcome
variables, a 20% difference in mean post-
prandial glycemia as measured by iAUC.
Twenty-eight participants were required
to complete both interventions. Data
were analyzed according to intention
to treat. Analyses of CGM data were
performed with a mixed model account-
ing for intervention order. An interaction
between each glycemic variable and
weight change during the intervention
period was considered. For pre- and

postintervention measures, we com-
pared the difference in one intervention
with the difference in the other inter-
vention. The data for CGM variables,
triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, alkylresor-
cinols, and markers of inflammation
were log-transformed to address skew.
Analyses were performed using Stata
15(StataCorp,CollegeStation,TX).Results
are mean 6 SD unless otherwise stated.

RESULTS

The flow of participants through the
trial is shown in Fig. 1. Of the 31 partic-
ipants with type 2 diabetes randomized,
28 (90%) completed both interventions.
Fourteen (45%) of the 31 participants
were female. Mean age was 63 6
13 years. Mean HbA1c was 7.5 6 3.4%
(596 14mmol/mol), andmean diabetes
durationwas 11.46 9 years. Participants
self-identified as being of New Zealand
European (n 5 25, 81%), Māori (n 5 3,
10%), European (n 5 2, 6%), or Indian
(n 5 1, 3%) ethnicity. The majority of
participants were on oral hypoglycemic
agents metformin and/or gliclazide (n5
19, 61%), with nine (29%) on both oral
hypoglycemic agents and insulin and
three (10%) able to control their blood
glucose with diet alone. Three (10%)
participants were current smokers.

Characteristics of the intervention foods
are shown in Table 1, with full details
of the sieve analysis available in the
Supplementary Material. Dietary intakes
before and during the interventions are
shown in Table 2. During both interven-
tion periods, total carbohydrate, starch,
and dietary fiber increased at the ex-
pense of fat intake compared with base-
line levels. Intakes of all macronutrients
and dietary fiber were comparable
between the two interventions. The
increase in alkylresorcinols during the
less-processed whole-grain intervention
(from 55.86 63 to 141.26 295 nmol/L)
was comparable (P 5 0.403) with the
increase during the intervention of finely
milled whole grains (from 49.5 6 41 to
171.9 6 336 nmol/L). During the inter-
ventions, participants consumed a mean
intake of 5.5 6 1.3 servings of less-
processed whole grains or 5.56 1.4 serv-
ings of finelymilledwhole grains each day.
The most servings of whole grains were
consumed at breakfast (2.3 6 0.9 and
2.2 6 0.9) and then at lunch (1.8 6 0.8
and 1.86 0.7) and dinner (1.46 0.8 and
1.4 6 0.8) for less-processed whole grains
and finelymilledwhole grains, respectively.

Measures of glycemia are shown in
Table 3. The mean iAUC of the 3 h
following all the breakfast meals was
9% (95% CI 3–15) lower during the

Figure 1—Flowchart of participants through the study.

2 weeks of consuming less-processed
whole grains than during the weeks
when finely milled whole grains were
consumed. The mean postprandial re-
sponse to the average of all meals
showed a similar trend, being 6% (1–
10) lower. Glycemic variability reduced
when participants consumed the less-
processed whole grains compared with
the finely milled whole grains as mea-
sured by MAGE (20.36 [95% CI 20.65
to 20.08]) and the SD of the mean
glucose value (20.16 mmol/L [95%
CI 20.25 to 20.06]). The study was
not powered to consider differences in
response between participants on the
basis of sex or ethnicity.
Anthropometricmeasures and cardiome-

tabolic risk factorsmeasured preintervention

and after each intervention are shown in
Table 4. Body weight increased during
the finely milled whole-grain interven-
tion and decreased when less-processed
whole grains were consumed, resulting
in a statistically significant mean differ-
ence in weight change (0.81 kg [95% CI
0.62–1.05]). This change in body weight
was not a mediating factor for the gly-
cemic variables considered (Table 3).
There were no differences observed be-
tween interventions for blood lipids, in-
sulin, inflammatory markers, or blood
pressure.

CONCLUSIONS

Consuming less-processed whole-grain
foods over 2 weeks improved measures
of glycemia in free-living adults with

type 2 diabetes compared with an
equivalent amount of whole-grain
foods that were finely milled to reduce
their particle size. All whole-grain foods
met the definition of being 100% whole
grain and had a similar composition in
termsofdietaryfiber andmacronutrients.
Whole-grain foods derived from wheat,
oats, and brown rice were provided ad
libitum to participants, with the amount
consumed balanced between interven-
tions. The reduction in glycemia was par-
ticularly striking after breakfast, whenmore
servings of whole-grain foods were eaten
than at other times during the day. Mea-
sures of day-long glycemic variability also
improved, suggesting potential benefits in
terms of reduced protein glycation and
cardiovascular risk (20–22). Although the

only difference between the two interven-
tionperiodsrelatedtowhole-grainstructure
as determined by milling and the reported
energy intake did not differ, a different
pattern of weight change was observed.
Consumption of the less-processedwhole-
grain foods was associated with a mean
reduction of body weight, whereas there
appeared to be a modest increase during
the 2-week period where finely milled
whole-grain foods were provided. There
was no indication that the weight differ-
ence explained the improvements in gly-
cemia associated with the less-processed
whole-grain foods characterized by larger
particle size.
Several plausible mechanisms could

explain the overall observation that
the degree of whole-grain processing,
as characterized by whole-grain particle
size as a result of milling, alters starch

digestibility. First, less-processed whole
grains may pass through the small in-
testine to be digested in the colon by the
microbiome into short-chain fatty acids
(23),whichareabsorbedwithoutaltering
circulating blood glucose levels. Second,
smaller whole-grain particle size associ-
ated with milling allows water and en-
zymes easier access to the starch and
enables catalytic activity, which alters
the rateof glucose absorption (24). Third,
the milling of whole grains to flour re-
moves thecompartmentalizationofstarch,
affecting starch and protein interactions,
which may further affect digestion rate
(25). The differing pattern in bodyweight
change between the interventions was
unexpected. However, there are several
possible explanations. A higher propor-
tion of the intact whole grain may have
escaped digestion in the small intestine

to be either metabolized in the large
bowel or have avoided anaerobic me-
tabolism entirely. It is also conceivable
that digestion of less-processed whole
grains may be associated with a greater
thermic effect than the digestion of
whole grains that are more finely ground
(26).

A body of work supports benefits in
postprandial glycemia when comparing
whole-grain consumption with refined
grains (27). Fewer studies have consid-
ered glycemia following the consump-
tion of intact or processed whole grains
(11,28–30). To our knowledge, the lon-
gest intervention relevant to this issue
by Järvi et al. (28) reported on two
different diets followed for 24 days by
adults with type 2 diabetes. Diets
were nutrient matched and provided
the same foods; however, in one diet,

the carbohydrate-dense foods, includ-
ing whole grains, were milled, reducing
particle size to produce a difference in
glycemic index. Following the interven-
tions, glucose was assessed over 1 day
in a controlled setting. As with the cur-
rent study, Järvi et al. reported improved
glycemia following the intervention with
less-processed foods of larger particle
size. Older acute studies considering the
structural integrity of whole grains on
postprandial glycemia also confirm our
findings (29,31,32). More recently, we
have shown an inverse trend between
postprandial glycemia and whole-grain
particle size in breads in a controlled
setting (11).
Current definitions of whole grains

permit a wide range of processing meth-
ods and require that reconstitution of
grain components is to the same ratio as
they exist in an intact grain (7,8). The
findings of this trial have immediate
relevance to clinical guidelines for di-
abetes management, which currently
recommend diets high in whole-grain
foods without reference to grain struc-
ture or particle size (5,6,33). Given that
other health benefits of whole-grain
foods (1,9) may also be influenced by
their processing, our data provide evi-
dence for a reviewof the definition of the
termwhole grain by relevant authorities.
A revised definition may reduce the
number of health or content claims
made for a range of ultraprocessed foods
by virtue of their whole-grain content.
Such products can also have high con-
tents of sodium, free sugars, or saturated
fats as well as total calories.
This trial has a number of strengths.

Participants were free living and con-
suming the provided whole-grain foods
within the context of their usual diet,
increasing the generalizability of these
results. As far as we are aware, this is the
first study of this topic to use CGM
systems. This has enabledmore intensive
blood glucose monitoring than has pre-
viously been possible and consideration
of day-long glycemic variability and daily
time spent in range and while hypergly-
cemic and hypoglycemic. Furthermore,
this study used alkylresorcinols in
plasma, providing an objective measure
of adherence to the whole-grain inter-
ventions. The absence of objective mea-
sures of intervention adherence is a
recognized limitationofprevious studies.
The trial does have some limitations. It

was of insufficient duration to observe
potential changes in HbA1c or the lipid
profile. The trial was insufficiently pow-
ered to consider subgroup analyses
according to participant glycemic con-
trol, medication type, sex, or ethnicity.
The trial was also insufficiently powered
to consider specific whole-grain foods
or other variables that may influence
the outcomes measured. Finally, the
participants of this trial were volunteers
who are not necessarily representative
of the population of people with type 2
diabetes and, therefore, may be more
likely to adhere to the trial interven-
tions (34). Future larger and longer
studies are planned to resolve these
questions.

Consuming less-processed whole-
grain foods achieved an improvement
in postprandial glycemia and other in-
dices of glycemic control in adults with
type 2 diabetes compared with consum-
ing whole-grain foods where the grain
particle size was further reduced through
milling. These findings suggest that main-
taining the structural integrity of whole
grains in foods available for consumption
will likely have long-term health benefits.
Our findings are highly relevant to nutri-
tional guidelines for diabetes management
and suggest practical means for those
wishing to improve their blood glucose
control. They may also contribute to dis-
cussion regarding a revision of the defini-
tion of the term whole grains and,
consequently, use of the term in front-of-
pack labeling claims.
