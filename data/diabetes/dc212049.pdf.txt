OBJECTIVE

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a liver phenotype of type 2 diabetes
and obesity. Currently, the efficacy of sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) in-
hibitors and sulfonylureas in liver pathology and hepatic gene expression profiles
for type 2 diabetes with NAFLD are unknown.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

We conducted a 48 week, randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial involving
participants with biopsy-confirmed NAFLD. A total of 40 participants were ran-
domly assigned to receive once daily 20 mg tofogliflozin or 0.5 mg glimepiride.
The primary outcome was the percentage of participants with at least an im-
provement in all individual scores for histological categories of steatosis, hepato-
cellular ballooning, lobular inflammation, and fibrosis by at least 1 point. The
secondary end points were the changes in liver enzymes, metabolic markers, and
hepatic gene expression profiles.

RESULTS

Fibrosis scores improved in the tofogliflozin group (60%, P = 0.001), whereas the
change from baseline did not differ significantly between the groups (P = 0.172).
The histological variables of steatosis (65%, P = 0.001), hepatocellular ballooning
(55%, P = 0.002), and lobular inflammation (50%, P = 0.003) were improved in the
tofogliflozin group, whereas only hepatocellular ballooning was improved in the
glimepiride group (25%, P = 0.025). Hepatic gene expression profiling revealed
histology-associated signatures in energy metabolism, inflammation, and fibrosis
that were reversed with tofogliflozin.

CONCLUSIONS

Tofogliflozin and, to a lesser degree, glimepiride led to liver histological and met-
abolic improvement in participants with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD, with no sig-
nificant difference between the agents. The hepatic expression of the genes
involved in energy metabolism, inflammation, and fibrosis was well correlated
with liver histological changes and rescued by tofogliflozin. We need further con-
firmation through long-term larger-scale clinical trials of SGLT2 inhibitors.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD),
ranging from simple fatty liver to nonal-
coholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is a liver
phenotype of metabolic disorders, such
as diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidemia
(1). NAFLD and type 2 diabetes share
epidemiological and pathophysiological
features. Specifically, hyperglycemia is
closely associated with liver fibrosis (2),
which is associated with liver cirrhosis,
hepatocellular carcinoma, and prognosis
in participants with NASH (3–5).
To date, some antidiabetes agents have

been tested in participants with NAFLD
(6–9). The guidelines in the Asian Pacific,
European, and American associations rec-
ommended the administration of a per-
oxisome proliferator–activated receptor-
g (PPAR g) agonist (pioglitazone) and
glucagon-like peptide receptor agonists
(GLP-1 RA) for the treatment of diabetes
with NAFLD/NASH (10–12). However, there
are concerns about adverse effects, such as
weight gain, edema, fractures, and carcino-
genesis, with pioglitazone or gastrointestinal
adverse effects and medication burden as
an injection with GLP-1 RA. Because all of
these antidiabetes agents significantly re-
duced glycemic levels compared with pla-
cebo, liver histological improvement may
be theoretically attributable to glucose re-
duction itself.
Both sodium–glucose cotransporter 2

(SGLT2) inhibitors and sulfonylureas are
chosen as second-line therapy when glyce-
mic control cannot be achieved with metfor-
min or as first-line therapy when metformin
is contraindicated or not tolerated (13).
In animal models of NAFLD/NASH,

SGLT2 inhibitors protect against fibrosis
(14,15), steatosis (15), and inflammation
(15). Ipragliflozin improved liver histology
due to reduction of the hepatic triglycer-
ides and lipotoxicity in NASH-model mice
with type 2 diabetes (15). To our knowledge,
among past studies investigating effects
of SGLT2 inhibitors on NAFLD in partici-
pants with type 2 diabetes, most of them
have demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors
exert protective effects on liver enzymes
(16–20) and liver steatosis evaluated with
MRS (21–26). To date, three studies have
evaluated liver histology. Two were single-
arm observation studies lacking a control
group (27,28). However, these studies
lacked a control group or histological ex-
amination, which precludes meaningful
conclusions since the natural course of
the disease or tight glycemic control
may ameliorate liver histology in some

participants with NAFLD (2). Only one
study evaluated the effects of ipragliflo-
zin versus conventional treatments on
liver histology in a 72 week randomized
controlled trial (29). In this study, ipra-
gliflozin reduced ballooning and fibrosis,
but, unexpectedly, not steatosis scores.

Sulfonylureas are still reliable and
potent antidiabetes agents in insulino-
penic participants with type 2 diabe-
tes and therefore are used as second-
line therapy, especially when the cost
is a significant issue. Past studies sug-
gest that sulfonylureas are associated
with NAFLD progression or adverse out-
comes such as hepatocellular carcinoma
(30–32), possibly via exaggerating insulin
secretion and thereby enhancing weight
gain and SREBP-1c–driven de novo lipo-
genesis. On the other hand, sulfonylur-
eas reduce glucose and thereby may
reduce carbohydrate response element
binding protein (ChREBP)-1–driven de
novo lipogenesis. Therefore, sulfonylur-
eas may render positive and negative ef-
fects, respectively, on liver pathology in
NAFLD/NASH. In the phase 3 trial, cana-
gliflozin was noninferior to glimepiride for
the reduction of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)
at 52 weeks (33). However, the differ-
ences between SGLT2 inhibitors and sul-
fonylureas on NAFLD participants with
type 2 diabetes under similar glucose
level reduction remain uncertain.

The clinicopathological analyses re-
vealed that the reduction in HbA1c and
the use of insulin independently con-
tribute to the reduction in liver fibrosis
scores during the histological course of
NAFLD development (2). These findings
led us to hypothesize that glycemic con-
trol and insulin ameliorate or protect
against the histological progression of
liver fibrosis in participants with NAFLD.

In the current study, we investigated
the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitor tofogliflo-
zin and sulfonylurea glimepiride, which
lower glucose levels similarly with reduction
and elevation in circulating insulin levels,
respectively, in NAFLD participants with
type 2 diabetes for 48 weeks by examin-
ing liver histology as well as hepatic en-
zymes, metabolic markers, and hepatic
gene expression profiles.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Participants
This randomized, open-label, active-controlled
trial was conducted at a single center

(Kanazawa University Hospital) in Japan.
The trial consisted of a 48 week treat-
ment period. The protocol was approved
by the Kanazawa University Certified Review
Board, Ishikawa, Japan (CRB4180005).
This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.
gov number NCT02649465 and the Japan
Registry of Clinical Trials (jRCTs041180132)
from UMIN 000020544.

Eligibility for the trial was determined
at screening using standard blood tests,
clinical history (including written confir-
mation of drug history, where necessary),
and physical examination/observations to
identify other illnesses or contraindications.

Fatty liver is clinically diagnosed when
a bright liver or hepatorenal echo con-
trast is observed on the abdominal ultra-
sonography. We excluded all other liver
disorders in each patient. All participants
reported drinking <20 g/day of ethanol.
All liver biopsies were performed during
hospitalizations. All biopsies were ob-
tained after a thorough clinical evalua-
tion and obtaining a receipt of signed
informed consent from each patient. The
trial entry criteria are based on a diagno-
sis of “definite” NAFLD with type 2 dia-
betes on liver biopsy specimen obtained
within 12 weeks of screening. All the
participants had to be $20 years of age
at the time of the initial screening.

Key exclusion criteria included hepatic
virus infections, autoimmune hepatitis,
primary biliary cirrhosis, and the use of
agents known to induce steatosis or ex-
cessive alcohol consumption. Full eligibil-
ity criteria are in the protocol study (34).

Study Design
The schedules for the study visits and
data collection are summarized in Supple-
mentary Table 1. All of the participants
were asked to attend each visit under a
minimum 8 h fasting state before each
visit. A follow-up liver biopsy was obtained
under ultrasound guidance after comple-
tion of the 48 week study treatment.

Participants were randomly assigned on
a 1:1 ratio to receive once-daily tofogliflo-
zin at a dose of 20 mg or glimepiride at an
initial dose of 0.5 mg. Randomization was
performed with the use of computer-
generated randomization. The participants
in the SGLT2 inhibitor group received tofo-
gliflozin (fixed dose of 20 mg/day; brand
name: Deberza, Kowa Company Ltd., Na-
goya, Japan), and the participants in the
sulfonylurea group received glimepiride

(starting from 0.5 mg/day and titrated up
to 6.0 mg/day; Sanofi-Aventis, Quebec,
Canada) for 48 weeks (Supplementary
Fig. 1). Previous treatment with oral anti-
diabetes drugs and metabolic-related med-
ications was continued at the same dose
in participants from 12 weeks before enroll-
ment. The participants were not allowed
any new prescriptions or dose changes.

In addition to study medications, the
participants continued to undergo life-
style modifications (i.e., exercise, weight
loss, and dietary adjustment) and man-
agement of various coexisting illnesses
throughout the trial. The participants
were asked to limit alcohol consumption
to <20 g/day for women and 30 g/day
for men. All of the participants received
an hour of nutritional counseling by an
experienced dietitian before the 48 week
treatment period. The experienced dieti-
tians were unaware of the study assign-
ments. In addition, all of the participants
were given a standard calorie diet
(30 kcal/kg/day; carbohydrates, 50–60%;
fat, 20–30%; and protein, 15–20%) and
exercise (5–6 MET estimations for 30 min
daily) counseling before the study.

Screening biopsy results were used as
the baseline for histological variables,
and a second biopsy was performed at
week 48. A single pathologist (K.H.),
who was blind to both clinical informa-
tion (e.g., treatment assignments, par-
ticipants' characteristics, and the order
in which the biopsy specimens were ob-
tained), histologically evaluated all bi-
opsy specimens. The biopsied tissues
were scored for steatosis (from 0 to 3),
stage (from 0 to 4), and grade (from 0
to 3), as previously described (35), ac-
cording to the standard criteria of Brunt
et al. (36). The NAFLD activity score
(NAS) was calculated as the unweighted
sum of the scores for steatosis (0–3),
lobular inflammation (0–3), and hepato-
cellular ballooning (0–2) (37).

Outcomes
The primary outcome measure was as-
sessed using an intention-to-treat analy-
sis of the percentage of participants with
at least 1 point improvement in each his-
tological score of steatosis, hepatocellu-
lar ballooning, lobular inflammation, and
fibrosis between liver biopsies at base-
line and after 48 weeks of treatment.

Confirmatory secondary histological end
points included the changes in the overall

NAS, individual components of NAS, and
fibrosis stages. Other secondary end points
included changes in serum liver-related
markers, glucose metabolism, body com-
positions, lipid profiles, oxidative stress
markers, and cytokines levels; details are
in the protocol study (34).

The body composition was predicted
using a segmental bioelectrical impedance
analysis (InBody 720). This device provides
information about body fat mass, per-
centage of body fat, and skeletal muscle
mass, among others. The measurement
procedure required the subject to stand
with bare feet on the analyzer and to
hold a pair of handgrips, one in each
hand. These conditions refer to the manu-
facturer’s recommended standard condi-
tions for the InBody 720 device, which
works by the segmental multifrequency-
bioelectrical impedance analysis method.

The Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index is a non-
invasive tool (i.e., FIB-4 index = age ×
AST/[platelet count × (ALT)1/2]) for as-
sessing liver fibrosis. The FIB-4 index is
easy to use in clinical practice, and its
diagnostic capability for advanced fibro-
sis is comparable to that of magnetic
resonance elastography (38).

Serial gene expression analyses were
performed using liver biopsy samples ob-
tained from participants before and after
administration of tofogliflozin or glime-
piride. The liver biopsy specimens stored
in liquid nitrogen were once immersed
in RNAlater (Ambion, Austin, TX) over-
night and homogenized in lysis buffer by
TissueLyser (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
Total RNA was isolated using the RNAqu-
eous kit (Ambion), as previously reported
(39). The quality of the isolated RNA was
estimated after electrophoresis using an
Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Palo Alto, CA).
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed
by using the SMART-Seq Stranded Kit (Takara
Bio, Kusatsu, Shiga, Japan) and NovaSeq
6000 Sequencing System (Illumina, San Di-
ego, CA). Expression data were processed
by BRB-ArrayTools (https://brb.nci.nih.gov/
BRB-ArrayTools). In brief, the library prep-
aration was performed by using SMART-
Seq Stranded Kit (Takara Bio) following
the manufacturer’s recommendations.
PCR was performed for 5 cycles before
rRNA depletion and 15 cycles during the
last library amplification. The libraries
were sequenced on the Illumina Nova-
Seq 6000. The paired-end reads of each
sample were aligned to the human ge-
nome (hg38) using Subread (40), and

transcript abundance was shown by the
count data using high-throughput se-
quence analysis (41). Count data were fil-
tered and normalized by BRB-ArrayTools
(https://brb.nci.nih.gov/BRB-ArrayTools).
Differentially expressed genes of paired
samples were obtained by edgeR with
the generalized linear model likelihood
ratio test approach. Functional ontology
enrichment analysis was conducted to
compare the Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways
and the gene ontology of the biological
processes distribution of the differen-
tially expressed genes. Least squares/
Kolmogorov-Smirnov permutation tests
were performed for pathway compari-
son (P < 0.005) (BRB-ArrayTools). Gene
set enrichment analysis was done using
the single-cell RNA-seq gene signature
(42). To characterize which cell compo-
nents contributed to the gene expression,
representative gene sets of hepatocytes
(1–6), cholangiocytes, central liver sinusoi-
dal endothelial cells (LSECs), periportal
LSECs, portal endothelial cells, stellate cells,
inflammatory macrophages, noninflamma-
tory macrophages, abT cells, gdT cells-1,
gdT cells-2, natural killer cells, mature B
cells, plasma cells, and erythroid cells were
retrieved from a previously reported study
(42). Functional ontology enrichment anal-
ysis was conducted to compare the distri-
bution of the differentially expressed genes
in each cell component.

Statistical Analysis
At the time of the study design, we had
no available data to estimate the histolog-
ical response with a 48 week treatment
using tofogliflozin and glimepiride. There-
fore, we estimated the sample size based
on findings of other studies on non-
SGLT2 inhibitors as follows: Based on
clinical trials of non-SGLT2 inhibitors for
NAFLD that had improvements in liver
histology as a primary end point, we as-
sumed that 52.6–69.0% of participants
undergoing treatment would demonstrate
an improvement in NAFLD (7,43). We es-
timated that there would be an improve-
ment in liver histology in 17.6–19.0% of
the placebo-control arm participants, based
on the literature (7,43). We calculated a
sample size of 14 in each group, for a sig-
nificance level of 0.05 (type I error) and a
power of 0.90 (type II error). This design
required 40 evaluable participants in the
treatment group. The published literature

in NAFLD trials reported, an average partic-
ipant withdrawal rate of 10–20% (43,44).
The statistical analyses were performed

with an intention-to-treat principle to as-
certain safety and adverse effects. Base-
line characteristics of the two study groups
are summarized with frequencies for cate-
gorical variables and with means (SD) in
the normally distributed variables or me-
dian (interquartile range) in the nonnor-
mally distributed continuous variables. We
performed the Shapiro-Wilk test to evalu-
ate the assumption of a normal distribu-
tion. The between-group comparison at
baseline was performed with the x2 test
or the Fisher test for categorical variables
and with the Mann-Whitney U test in the
nonnormal distribution or the two-sample
t test in the normal distribution for contin-
uous parameters.
We statistically evaluated changes in

each histological score before and after
the intervention with the Wilcoxon signed
rank test and between the groups for the
treatment effect (change from baseline)
with the x2 test, according to analyses of
previous hepatic histological scores (6).
Primary outcomes measures are eight be-
cause each of the four histological fea-
tures was analyzed in the two treatments
arms. The significance of differences was
defined as P < 0.00625 (0.05/8), adjust-
ing for the Bonferroni multiple testing.
The intergroup comparison of contin-

uous parameters was performed with
the Mann-Whitney U test in the non-
normal distribution or the two-sample
t test in the normal distribution. The inter-
nal group comparison between baseline
and 48 weeks was performed with the
Wilcoxon signed rank test. Data pertaining
to the major clinical events of interest are
presented as frequencies and percentages
for categorical variables. We examined
the association between the baseline char-
acteristics, the change in the laboratory
data, and the change in histology in both
groups by using the Spearman analysis. A
P value of <0.05 was regarded as statisti-
cally significant. All analyses were per-
formed with SPSS Statistics 25.0 software
(IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).

RESULTS

From March 2016 through December
2019, a total of 40 participants were
randomly assigned to receive once daily
tofogliflozin at a dose of 20 mg (20 partici-
pants) or to receive once daily glimepiride

at a final mean dose of 0.8 mg (20 par-
ticipants). All 40 participants (100%)
completed the trial. Information for the
primary and confirmatory secondary out-
comes related to a biopsy at week 48 was
available for 39 participants (97.5%). For
only one patient with a serious adverse
event (pancreatic cancer) (Supplementary
Fig. 1), the liver histology scores were im-
puted as nonresponse using an intention-
to-treat analysis. All of the participants
analyzed were >80% in compliance of
study medication. A total of 15 of 20 par-
ticipants assigned to tofogliflozin and 16
of 20 assigned to glimepiride achieved
100% compliance with the study medica-
tion in the current study (Supplementary
Table 2).

Demographic and baseline clinical
characteristics, except for sex, were simi-
lar in both groups (Tables 1 and 2, and
Supplementary Tables 3–6). All partici-
pants were Japanese and had type 2 dia-
betes. The mean age was 53.9 years,
mean NAS was 4.45, mean HbA1c was
8.2%, and mean weight was 82.0 kg
(Table 1). A total of 18 participants
(45.0%) had stage F1 fibrosis, 11 (27.5%)
had stage F2, and 5 (12.5%) had stage
F3 (Table 2).

Fibrosis scores improved in the tofo-
gliflozin group (60%, P = 0.001 for the
comparison of scores before and after
treatment), but the change from base-
line did not differ significantly between
the tofogliflozin group and the glimepir-
ide group (P = 0.172) (Table 2). In addi-
tion, subjects who received tofogliflozin
had significant histological improvements
from baseline to 48 weeks in all varia-
bles (ratios of the participants with im-
provement in steatosis, hepatocellular
ballooning, and lobular inflammation were
65, 55, and 50%, respectively). In the glime-
piride group, the histological improvement
from baseline to 48 weeks was the ten-
dency to be a reduction in only hepatocellu-
lar ballooning, adjusting for the Bonferroni
multiple testing.

NAS improved significantly compared
with baseline values in both groups,
and the beneficial effects were greater
in the tofogliflozin group (P = 0.002)
(Supplementary Table 4). There was an
early and highly significant decrease in
ALT and AST levels in the tofogliflozin
group (Fig. 1A and B). The changes from
baseline did not differ significantly be-
tween the tofogliflozin group and the
glimepiride group (Supplementary Table 4).

The changes of g-glutamyl transferase
were significantly reduced in the tofo-
gliflozin group (P < 0.001 for the com-
parison with glimepiride) (Fig. 1C and
Supplementary Table 4). Moreover, the
FIB-4 index was significantly reduced in
the tofogliflozin group, and the effects
were greater in the tofogliflozin group
(P = 0.015) (Fig. 1D and Supplementary
Table 4).

The decrease in glycemic parameters,
such as fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c,
were similar (Fig. 1E and Supplementary
Table 5). Weight, BMI, and percentage of
body fat were significantly reduced in the
tofogliflozin group (a mean weight de-
crease of 4.2 kg at week 48, P < 0.001
compared with glimepiride) (Fig. 1F and
Supplementary Table 5). These changes
occurred in the first 12 weeks and were
sustained throughout the period. In con-
trast, the changes in C-peptide response,
lipid profile, oxidative stress markers, and
cytokines were similar in both groups
(Supplementary Tables 5 and 6).

We examined the association between
the change in various clinical parameters
and the change in liver histology in both
treatment arms by the Spearman analysis
(Supplementary Table 7). The reduction in
body weight was significantly associated
with the reduction in steatosis scores in
the tofogliflozin group. The reduction in
HbA1c was significantly associated with
the reduction in steatosis scores in both
groups. Higher baseline HbA1c (r = 0.582,
P = 0.007) and the reduction in HbA1c
(r = 0.524, P = 0.018) were significantly
associated with the reduction in fibrosis
scores only in the tofogliflozin group.

To understand molecular signatures of
tofogliflozin and glimepiride in the liver, we
examined global hepatic gene expression
profiles using RNA-seq before and after
the interventions. There was a significant
difference (P < 0.005) in the number of
genes expressed in the liver of the tofo-
gliflozin group compared with the glime-
piride group (663 genes in the tofogliflozin
group vs. 51 genes in the glimepiride
group). The pathway analyses of differ-
entially expressed genes according to
the KEGG pathways (Table 3) and the
gene ontology of the biological pro-
cesses (Supplementary Table 8) in serial
hepatic gene expression profiles showed
unique metabolic signatures in the to-
fogliflozin group compared with the
glimepiride group. Genes involved in
gluconeogenesis, fatty acid catabolism/

oxidation, and amino acids catabolism in
peroxisome were coordinately upregu-
lated in the tofogliflozin group. On the
other hand, genes involved in cell death,
stress response, inflammation, T-cell re-
sponse, and fibrosis were substantially
downregulated in the tofogliflozin group
but not in the glimepiride group (Table 3
and Supplementary Table 8).

Next, we performed gene set enrich-
ment analyses using gene sets associated
with resident cells in the liver defined by
single-cell RNA-seq analyses and corre-
sponding liver histological scores before
and after the tofogliflozin treatment (Fig.
2 and Supplementary Table 9) to further
address which components of resident
cells participate in the tofogliflozin-
mediated alleviation of NAFLD pathology.

Figure 2 shows one-way hierarchical cluster-
ing of 51 representative genes involved in
central LSECs and zone 2 and 3 hepatocytes
(left) and 59 genes involved in gdT cells,
inflammatory macrophages, stellate cells,
and plasma cells (right). Histological scores
of fibrosis, lobular inflammation, NAS, and
steatosis (%) are shown in individual pa-
tients before and after treatment, respec-
tively. Gene expression patterns were well
correlated with histological changes. The
51 genes involved in LSECs and zone 2
and 3 hepatocytes were coordinately
downregulated in the liver with severe
steatosis before treatment (left side of
left panel). Tofogliflozin upregulated the
expression of these genes (right side of
left panel). The 59 genes, representative
of gdT cells, inflammatory macrophages,

stellate cells, and plasma cells, showed
a similar gene expression pattern and
clustered in each cell component. These
genes were coordinately upregulated in
the liver with severe steatosis before
treatment (left side of right panel). Tofo-
gliflozin downregulated these genes
expression (right side of left panel). In con-
trast, glimepiride rather upregulated the
pathway for gdT cells (Supplementary
Table 9).

All adverse events occurred during
the on-treatment observation period.
Data are reported for all of the partici-
pants. The incidences of adverse events
were significantly higher in the tofogli-
flozin group. This difference was attrib-
utable to the increased incidence of
genital and urinary tract symptoms

ing pain, n = 1; cystitis, n = 1; nocturia,
n = 1; vaginal candida, n = 1) in the to-
fogliflozin group. Most adverse events
were mild or moderate, and no partici-
pants discontinued the treatment. Two
participants in the glimepiride group ex-
perienced mild or moderate hypoglyce-
mia: one patient in reduced prandial
dosing of rapid-acting insulin (total 36
to 30 units) due to hypoglycemia. One
serious adverse event, pancreatic can-
cer, occurred in the glimepiride group
but was considered not related to the
study (Supplementary Table 10).

CONCLUSIONS

In this open-label, randomized, parallel
trial, tofogliflozin and, to a lesser de-
gree, glimepiride significantly reduced
the score of liver histology for 48 weeks
in participants with liver biopsy speci-
men-confirmed NAFLD and type 2 dia-
betes, with no significant difference

between the agents under a similar re-
duction in glucose levels.

The percentage of participants in the
tofogliflozin group who had an improve-
ment in the fibrosis stage after 48 weeks
in this trial was 60%. As shown in
Supplementary Table 11, the tofogli-
flozin-mediated improvement in the
fibrosis stage in the current study is
greater than that reported with liraglu-
tide treatment (8), obeticholic acid treat-
ment (45), semaglutide treatment (9),
pioglitazone treatment (6,7), and vitamin
E treatment (7). The Spearman analysis
(Supplementary Table 7) showed that
the baseline fibrosis scores did not affect
the changes in histology scores after the
treatments. Unexpectedly, the percentage
of participants in the tofogliflozin group
who had an improvement in steatosis,
hepatocellular ballooning, and lobular in-
flammation in this trial (65, 55, and 50%,
respectively) was not greater than that
reported with liraglutide treatment (8),
obeticholic acid treatment (45), and

pioglitazone treatment (6,7). These find-
ings suggest that tofogliflozin may prefer-
entially ameliorate liver fibrosis compared
with liraglutide, semaglutide, obeticholic
acid, liraglutide, pioglitazone, and vitamin E.

The systematic review (46) reported
that SGLT2 inhibitors improved liver his-
tology, such as liver steatosis and fibro-
sis, in participants with NAFLD according
to findings from the single-arm clinical
trials (27,28). However, a recent system-
atic review demonstrated SGLT2 inhibi-
tors may not reduce liver fibrosis (47).
Our randomized controlled trial study is
the first to characterize the greater im-
provement in NAFLD histology, especially
fibrosis, with tofogliflozin.

The percentage of participants with
improvement in the fibrosis stage in the
glimepiride group in this trial was 35%,
similar to the percentage of participants
with obeticholic acid treatment (45) and
greater than that reported in the pla-
cebo participants (6–9). On the other

ings in our study suggest that glimepiride
also preferentially ameliorates liver fibro-
sis. Collectively from the characteristic

improvement of liver histology by to-
fogliflozin and glimepiride, glucose re-
duction may reduce liver fibrosis, at least
partly, independently of steatosis and

and plasma cells (right). Histological scores of fibrosis, lobular inflammation, NAS, and steatosis (%) are shown in individual patients before and after
treatment, respectively. Gene expression patterns were well correlated with histological changes. The 51 genes involved in LSECs and zone 2 and 3 hepa-
tocytes were coordinately downregulated in the liver with severe steatosis before treatment (left side of left panel). Tofogliflozin upregulated these genes
expression (right side of left panel). The 59 genes, representative of gdT cells, inflammatory macrophages, stellate cells, and plasma cells, showed a simi-
lar gene expression pattern and clustered in each cell component. These genes were coordinately upregulated in the liver with severe steatosis before
treatment (left side of right panel). Tofogliflozin downregulated these genes expression (right side of left panel).

hemoglobin was similar in both groups,
consistent with a phase 3 noninferiority
trial (33). Weight, BMI, and fat mass were
reduced only in the tofogliflozin group. In
the subanalysis (Supplementary Table 7),
reduction in steatosis scores was signifi-
cantly associated with the tofogliflozin-me-
diated reduction in HbA1c and weight. On
the other hand, reduction in fibrosis scores
was significantly associated with HbA1c at
baseline and the tofogliflozin-mediated gly-
cemic control but not the reduction in
weight. These findings suggest that glyce-
mic control, rather than weight reduction,
contributes to liver fibrosis alleviation.
Pioglitazone has several safety concerns,

such as weight gain, heart failure, fluid re-
tention, bone fracture, and bladder cancer.
The GLP-1 RAs often cause gastrointestinal
symptoms (8,9). The reduction in body fat
with tofogliflozin may have a potentially
helpful therapeutic effect on the future
risk of cardiovascular events and prema-
ture death in participants with NAFLD,
although longer-term outcome studies
are needed to confirm this point.
The mechanisms by which SGLT2 inhib-

itors ameliorate NAFLD pathology remain
underinvestigated in humans. In the current
study, pathway analyses of differentially ex-
pressed genes according to the KEGG
pathways and gene ontology of the bio-
logical processes in serial hepatic gene
expression profiles showed unique meta-
bolic signatures in the tofogliflozin group
compared with the glimepiride group. In
the tofogliflozin group, genes involved in
gluconeogenesis were coordinately upregu-
lated, consistent with clinical observations
in which the SGLT2 inhibitor is associated
with an elevated endogenous glucose pro-
duction (48,49). Genes involved in fatty
acid catabolism/oxidation and amino acids
catabolism in peroxisome were coordi-
nately upregulated in the tofogliflozin
group, indicating enhanced lipolysis and
protein catabolism for gluconeogenesis
(50). The findings were compatible with
the upregulated pathways of cytochrome
P450 and retinol metabolisms, both acti-
vated by peroxisome proliferation in
mouse models (51).
Genes involved in cell death, stress

response, inflammation, T-cell response,
and fibrosis were substantially downre-
gulated in the tofogliflozin group but
not in the glimepiride group, which are
compatible with the tofogliflozin-mediated
alleviation of liver inflammation, hepa-
tocellular damage, and liver fibrosis.

Since glimepiride-mediated glucose lower-
ing did not alter the inflammation- and
fibrosis-related pathways, tofogliflozin may
exert unique pleiotropic effects beyond
glucose lowering.

To further address possible respon-
sive resident cells in the tofogliflozin-
mediated alleviation of NAFLD pathol-
ogy, we performed gene set enrichment
analyses using single-cell RNA-seq gene
signatures. Genes involved in zone 3
hepatocytes, which are rich in peroxi-
somes, and LSECs were coordinately
upregulated in the liver with severe
steatosis. On the other hand, genes in-
volved in gdT cells, inflammatory mac-
rophages, stellate cells, and plasma
cells, which play essential roles in the
pathogenesis of NAFLD, were coordi-
nately upregulated in the liver with se-
vere steatosis. Tofogliflozin rescued these
gene expression patterns; it upregulated
the genes involved in zone 3 hepatocytes
and LSECs and, in contrast, downregu-
lated the genes involved in gdT cells, in-
flammatory macrophages, stellate cells,
and plasma cells. Rescuing zone 3 hepa-
tocytes could enhance various redox
signalings, such as glutathione pathways,
that remove reactive oxygen species in-
duced by oxidative lipid (50). Therefore, it
might be possible that tofogliflozin sup-
presses inflammation and fibrosis via
the recovery of zone 3 hepatocytes.
Considering similar gene expression pat-
terns between zone 3 hepatocytes and
LSECs, LSECs may be novel therapeutic
targets for NAFLD, the hypothesis of
which should be confirmed by further
investigations.

Our study has some limitations. First,
the study is an open-label design, in-
cluding two open-label active treatment
arms without a placebo group. There-
fore, we cannot exclude the possibility
that the improvement in liver histology
in both groups could be attributed to
lifestyle modification through diet and
exercise counseling at baseline. Never-
theless, the strength of the current
study is to evaluate the effects of the
SGLT2 inhibitor on NALFD pathology by
comparing with those of the sulfonyl-
urea as an active control, both of which
similarly lower glucose levels with re-
duction and elevation in circulating in-
sulin levels, respectively, to clarify the
role of glucose and insulin separately.

Second, the percentage of sex was unbal-
anced in both groups after randomization.

However, there was no association be-
tween sex and the changes in liver histol-
ogy (Supplementary Table 7). Furthermore,
we analyzed the effects of the agents on
liver histology separately by sex, as summa-
rized in Supplementary Tables 12 and 13.
Almost similar results were obtained, except
that hepatocellular ballooning and lobular
inflammation in men of the tofogliflo-
zin group and hepatocellular balloon-
ing in both sexes of the glimepiride
group remain in the tendency or insuffi-
cient statistical significance, possibly due
to the small number of subjects. Based
on these findings, we concluded that sex
differences unlikely affected the conclu-
sion of the current study.

Third, although tofogliflozin improved
all of the liver histological scores, there
was no statistical difference in the ef-
fects with glimepiride. Past NAFLD clini-
cal trials (6–8) also observed that active
arms significantly improve fibrosis scores
but with no statistically significant differ-
ences between the active arms and
comparative agents/placebo. Such dis-
crepancies may be attributed to the
short study duration, the small number
of subjects, and the variations in the as-
sessment of liver histology by means of
percutaneous liver biopsy.

In conclusion, among participants with
biopsy specimen-confirmed NAFLD and
type 2 diabetes, tofogliflozin administra-
tion was associated with a significant
liver histology improvement compared
with glimepiride under similar glucose level
reduction. Tofogliflozin coordinately altered
hepatic expression of the genes involved in
energy metabolism, inflammation, and fi-
brosis, which may underlie liver pathology.
SGLT2 inhibitors may have a hepatoprotec-
tive effect, in addition to the previously rec-
ognized cardiorenal protective effects, and
could be promising agents in the treatment
of type 2 diabetes with NAFLD. Long-term
larger-scale placebo-controlled clinical trials
of SGLT2 inhibitors for participants with
type 2 diabetes and NAFLD are needed to
confirm our findings and to establish evi-
dence in hepatocarcinogenesis, incident
major adverse cardiovascular events, over-
all survival, and medical economics to be
adopted as the therapeutic guidelines for
type 2 diabetes and NAFLD.
