Abstract

Aim To quantify the association between behaviour change and weight loss after diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes, and the

likelihood of remission of diabetes at 5-year follow-up.

Method We conducted a prospective cohort study in 867 people with newly diagnosed diabetes aged 40–69 years from

the ADDITION-Cambridge trial. Participants were identified via stepwise screening between 2002 and 2006, and

underwent assessment of weight change, physical activity (EPAQ2 questionnaire), diet (plasma vitamin C and self-

report), and alcohol consumption (self-report) at baseline and 1 year after diagnosis. Remission was examined at 5 years

after diabetes diagnosis via HbA1c level. We constructed log binomial regression models to quantify the association

between change in behaviour and weight over both the first year after diagnosis and the subsequent 1–5 years, as well as

remission at 5-year follow-up.

Results Diabetes remission was achieved in 257 participants (30%) at 5-year follow-up. Compared with people who

maintained the same weight, those who achieved ≥ 10% weight loss in the first year after diagnosis had a significantly

higher likelihood of remission [risk ratio 1.77 (95% CI 1.32 to 2.38; p<0.01)]. In the subsequent 1–5 years, achieving

≥10% weight loss was also associated with remission [risk ratio 2.43 (95% CI 1.78 to 3.31); p<0.01].

Conclusion In a population-based sample of adults with screen-detected Type 2 diabetes, weight loss of ≥10% early in

the disease trajectory was associated with a doubling of the likelihood of remission at 5 years. This was achieved without

intensive lifestyle interventions or extreme calorie restrictions. Greater attention should be paid to enabling people to

achieve weight loss following diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes affects 400 million people globally and has

been characterized as a lifelong progressive disease [1,2];

however, biochemical remission or ‘cure’, defined as a level

of glycaemia below the diagnostic threshold (HbA1c < 48

mmol/mol or 6.5%) [3] in the absence of pharmacological or

surgical interventions, is achievable through significant

calorie restriction and weight loss [4,5]. Although there are

varying definitions of remission in the literature, we have

adhered to that based on HbA1c levels in line with UK and

US national guidance [3]. Intensive low-calorie diet (total

energy intake of 624–700 kcal/day) for 8 weeks was

associated with remission in 87% of people with recently

diagnosed diabetes (<4 years) and in 50% of people with

longstanding disease (>8 years)[4]. Similarly, the Action for

Health in Diabetes (Look AHEAD) study included an

intensive 4-year programme, designed to increase physical

activity and reduce initial weight by ≥7% [6]. Participants

had a median diabetes duration of 5 years and, in the first

year after the intervention, 11.5% achieved partial or

complete remission compared to only 2.0% in the usual

care group. In the DIRECT trial, participants who had been

diagnosed with diabetes in the previous 6 years underwent an

intensive intervention, including withdrawal of diabetes and

blood pressure medication, diet replacement of 825–853

kcal/day through a formula diet for 3–5 months, stepped

food reintroduction (2–8 weeks), and structured support for

long-term weight loss maintenance [7]. Remission was

achieved in 46% of the intervention group. Collectively,

these studies support the hypothesis that healthy behaviour

change and weight loss can result in remission of diabetes.

In all these studies, however, selected participants were

recruited to intensive weight loss interventions. Evidence is

therefore required from representative population-based

samples undergoing less intensive interventions that are

more feasible and potentially scalable to the wider popula-

tion. Furthermore, most studies have either examined remis-

sion in the short term or amongst people who have lived with

diabetes for a few years, or both [6,7]. It is unclear if

behaviour change and weight loss early in the disease

trajectory could lead to long-term remission. This is impor-

tant as there could be a window of opportunity following

diagnosis when people might be more receptive to interven-

tions concerning weight loss. Using data from the ADDI-

TION-Cambridge population-based study of screening for

Type 2 diabetes, we quantified the association between

behaviour change and weight loss in the year after diagnosis

and the subsequent 4 years, in relation to the likelihood of

remission of diabetes at 5-year follow-up.

Methods

Study design and setting

We conducted a cohort study analysis using prospectively

collected data from the ADDITION-Cambridge trial (regis-

tered as ISRCTN86769081). This is a pragmatic, parallel

group cluster randomized controlled trial conducted among

49 general practices in the East of England. Individuals aged

40–69 years who were not known to have diabetes and had a

Cambridge Diabetes Risk Score ≥ 0.17 (corresponding to the

top 25% of participants’ risk distribution) were invited to

attend a stepwise screening programme for Type 2 diabetes,

including initial random capillary glucose and HbA1c testing

followed by a fasting capillary glucose and a confirmatory

oral glucose tolerance test [8–10]. Diagnosis of Type 2

diabetes was based on the 1999 WHO criteria [11].

Exclusion criteria were current pregnancy, lactation, psychi-

atric disease that prevented informed consent, or an illness

with a likely prognosis of <1 year at the time of diabetes

diagnosis. All 867 participants identified by screening agreed

to participate and were randomized at a practice level into

either the intervention group (multifactorial treatment) or

control group (routine care). In the routine care group,

practices were advised to follow current UK national

guidelines for diabetes management [12]. Intensive treatment

comprised more frequent consultations, including a 30-min

annual review, in addition to three 10-min consultations

with a general practitioner and nurse, provision of educa-

tional materials and guidelines, and practice-based academic

detailing sessions, encouraging earlier use of medication to

improve control of risk factors, with a local diabetologist and

a general practitioner opinion leader who described treat-

ment algorithms and targets. A detailed description of the

trial has been reported in previous publications [8,9].

Exposure and outcome measurements

All measures were taken at baseline, 1- and 5-year follow-up.

Physical activity was assessed by self-report using the vali-

dated EPIC Physical Activity Questionnaire (EPAQ-2) [13].

Dietary intake was assessed by self-report using a validated

semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire, which

enabled estimation of daily intake of total energy, and fat as

a percentage of energy and fibre intake [14,15]. Alcohol intake

and smoking status (categorized as never smoked, ex-smoker

or current smoker) were assessed by self-report via question-

naire. Clinical and biochemical measures were collected by

trained staff following standardized protocols, as previously

described [12,17]. Blood pressure was calculated as the mean

of three measurements using an automatic sphygmomanome-

ter. Body weight and height were measured in light clothing

and without shoes using a scale (SECA) and a fixed rigid

stadiometer, respectively. Venous blood samples were col-

lected for analysis of lipid and HbA1c levels.

Remission was defined as an HbA1c level < 48 mmol/mol

(6.5%) in the absence of any diabetes medication or bariatric

surgery. Information on medication use and a history of

bariatric surgery was self-reported and we also reviewed

patient electronic general practice records. At baseline, none

of the participants included in this cohort were on any

hypoglycaemic agents. We then followed up the whole

cohort for 5 years, regardless of whether they were subse-

quently commenced on medications. Those who went into

remission were by definition not on hypoglycaemic medica-

tion at the 5-year follow-up.

What’s new?

• Biochemical remission of Type 2 diabetes in the absence

of pharmacological or surgical intervention has been

shown to be achievable.

• This has been previously demonstrated in short-term

studies and only in selected populations through inten-

sive weight loss programmes.

• We found that weight loss of ≥10% in the first few

years after diagnosis was strongly associated with

remission of Type 2 diabetes at 5 years.

• This was achieved without intensive lifestyle interven-

tions or extreme calorie restrictions.

• Our findings should inform discussions with people

who have newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes as a

motivation towards remission of the disease without

restrictive and sometimes unachievable calorie restric-

tions.

Statistical analysis

Data were pooled from both trial groups and presented for

the whole cohort, adjusted for trial group. Participant

characteristics were summarized at baseline and 1-year

follow-up using mean (SD) values or frequencies. To examine

differences in characteristics between participants who

achieved remission and those who did not, we used the chi-

squared and t-test as appropriate. We also examined differ-

ences between characteristics of participants with and

without missing data; we assessed predictors of missing

weight or remission information by comparing distributions

of factors measured at baseline between those who were and

were not missing weight or remission data. Percentage

weight change over the first year after diagnosis was the

main exposure variable. We also examined percentage

weight change between 1 and 5 years. We constructed

models using percentage weight change in four categories as

follows: no weight change (reference category as � 2.5%);

weight gain (≥2.5%); ≤ 2.5–5% weight loss; ≤5–10% weight

loss; and ≥10% weight loss. We also examined weight

change in kilograms as a continuous variable. Change over

the first year, and between 1 and 5 years in physical activity

and diet, as continuous variables (daily intake of total

energy, fat as a percentage of energy, fibre, alcohol and

plasma vitamin C), were then examined. We constructed log

binomial regression models to examine the association

between change in these exposures and 5-year risk of

remission, generating risk ratios and 95% CIs. Multivariable

nested models were then constructed adjusted on a priori

reasoning. Model 1 was adjusted for baseline weight and

follow-up period. Model 2 was additionally adjusted for age,

sex, ethnicity (white or other), education level (full-time

education finished at <16 years or >16 years, occupation

(managerial and professional, intermediate and manual) trial

group, date of diabetes diagnosis and clustering within

practices. Given the possibility that remission might be more

easily achieved amongst participants who had a lower HbA1c

level at baseline, we carried out a subgroup anlaysis that

included only those with an HbA1c level >48 mmol/mol.

Statistical analysis was conducted in STATA version 14 (Stata,

College Station, TX, USA)

Results

Participant characteristics

Of the 867 participants at baseline, 730 (84%) had weight

and HbA1c measures at 5-year follow-up and were included

in the analysis. The mean (SD) age of included participants

was 61 (7) years. Most were men (61%) and white (97%). A

total of 49% had continued in full-time education after the

age of 16 years and 43% reported unskilled or manual

occupations. At the 5-year follow-up, 55% of participants

had initiated hypoglycaemic medications. There were few

differences between those with and without data on weight

change and HbA1c. Compared with included participants,

those with missing data were less likely to have stayed in

education after age 16 years (15% and 11%, respectively).

Between baseline and 1-year follow-up, improvements

were seen in the majority of health behaviours and cardio-

vascular disease risk factors. Baseline participant character-

istics and changes over the first year are shown in Table 1,

stratified according to remission status at 5 years. Diabetes

remission was achieved in 257 participants (30%) in this

cohort. Those who achieved remission were more likely to be

men, smokers and to have remained in full-time education

after age 16 years.

Weight change and remission of diabetes at 5 years

In log binomial regression models, we observed that people

who lost ≥ 10% body weight in the first year after diagnosis

of diabetes were significantly more likely to achieve remis-

sion at 5 years compared to those with stable or increased

weight. We observed similar trends with more modest weight

loss of 5–10% or lower over the first year after diagnosis, but

this was not statistically significant; these results are shown

in Table 2. Similar associations were observed in the analysis

of unit changes in weight, with strong positive correlations

between 1-kg weight loss and remission, as shown in Table 4.

Similar trends were observed between 1 and 5 year follow-up

(Table 3). The greater the amount of weight loss achieved,

the higher the likelihood of remission in all models (Table

5). In the subgroup analysis of participants with a baseline

HbA1c >48 mmol/mol, similar trends were observed between

weight change and remission. This is shown in Tables S1 and

S2.

Behaviour change and remission of diabetes at 5 years

We did not observe any consistent patterns of associations

between unit changes in health behaviours and remission of

diabetes. A positive association with remission was noted

with unit changes in alcohol levels, but these varied between

unadjusted and adjusted models, which are shown in

Table 4.

Discussion

In this prospective cohort study, we investigated the

association between weight loss and remission of Type 2

diabetes at 5 years. We found that modest weight loss of

≥10% in the first year or first 5 years after diagnosis was

strongly associated with remission of Type 2 diabetes.

These findings suggest that remission is achievable without

intensive lifestyle interventions or extreme calorie restric-

tions.

The present findings support and add to previous research

that has demonstrated associations between weight loss and

remission of Type 2 diabetes [5,7,18]. For example, The

DIRECT trial, also set in UK primary care, reported varying

rates of remission of diabetes, depending on weight loss. The

trial had aimed for a 15-kg weight loss through an intensive

intervention that included withdrawal of antidiabetic and

anti-hypertensive drugs, total diet replacement (825–853

kcal/day formula diet for 3–5 months), stepped food

reintroduction (2–8 weeks), and structured support for

long-term weight loss maintenance. On average, 10 kg

(15%) of weight was lost in the intervention group and half

of the participants achieved remission. [7,19]. Other studies

with similar intensive interventions in highly selected popu-

lations include the Counterbalance trial and the Look

AHEAD trial. The Look AHEAD trial did not report

remission as a primary outcome, but did include intensive

support through dietary and physical activity programmes

which resulted in remission. Whilst our observational find-

ings are consistent with these trials, the specific amount of

weight loss required to achieve remission varies. Most

previous studies advocate significant weight loss (>15%),

with the DIRECT, Counterbalance and Look AHEAD trials

reporting between 5- and 20-kg weight loss in order to

achieve diabetes remission [5,7]. However, while baseline

HbA1c values were lower in our screen-detected cohort, our

results suggest that more modest weight loss of >10% is

associated with a higher likelihood of remission if this occurs

early in the disease trajectory. This may provide some

rationale for motivating people with newly diagnosed Type 2

diabetes to lose weight rather than focusing on specific and

potentially unachievable weight targets. Previous studies

have shown that, when attempting to lose weight, people

often set unrealistically high weight loss goals that could be

detrimental to success, and evidence on whether weight loss

counselling with specific targets is always successful is

inconsistent [20]. Indeed, the DIRECT trial did not manage

to achieve the weight loss targets intended for most partic-

ipants, with only 24% managing the 15-kg target weight loss

despite the intensive support. Furthermore, these

interventions are unlikely to be scalable to the wider

population because of their intensity and cost and the limited

availability of facilitators [7]. Our data suggest that, in

addition to extending availability of intensive weight loss

interventions, policymakers should consider a range of

accessible approaches targeting weight loss amongst people

with newly diagnosed diabetes.

Finally, while we observed associations between weight

change and remission, we did not observe consistent

associations between behaviour change and remission. This

might be attributable to the differential precision of the

exposure measurements, most of which were self-reported

and therefore subject to error and bias. For example, we

found that self-reported alcohol intake was associated with

remission. Although there is some mixed evidence in the

literature suggesting that moderate alcohol intake could be

associated with positive cardiovascular outcomes, our

findings were not consistent between adjusted and unad-

justed models [21]. It is therefore unlikely to be a true

association. It could be due to chance or residual con-

founding.

The present study included people with Type 2 diabetes

from a large population-based sample across an extensive

geographical area in the East of England in routine clinical

follow-up. We used measures of remission that are available

in clinical practice to allow translation of our findings to

practice. There was heterogeneity in this cohort with regard

to socio-economic groups, disease severity and health

behaviours. There were also no specific dietary or physical

activity restrictions for participants. This means that the

study is generalizable to wider diabetes populations outside

clinical trial cohorts; however, the sample was not ethnically

diverse, comprising predominantly white European partici-

pants, which reflects the local population. Other strengths

include the duration of follow-up which was 5 years; most

previous remission studies were of < 12 months’ duration.

Also, participant retention in the present cohort was high,

being 95% at 1-year follow-up and 83% at the 5-year

follow-up. Behaviours were measured using previously val-

idated questionnaires and repeated measures with the same

instruments, reducing our concerns about measurement

error. We did, however, conduct a number of hypothesis

tests, so chance remains a plausible explanation for our

findings.

In conclusion, remission of Type 2 diabetes is achievable in

the longer term with modest weight loss of >10% early in the

disease trajectory. This can be achieved without intensive

interventions in free-living populations. Our findings should

inform discussions with people who have newly diagnosed

Type 2 diabetes as motivation towards remission of the

disease without restrictive and sometimes unachievable

calorie restrictions. Further work is needed to replicate these

findings in more ethnically and socially diverse populations.

Further examination will need to include an assessment of

the relationship between remission and longer-term clinical

outcomes, such as mortality.
