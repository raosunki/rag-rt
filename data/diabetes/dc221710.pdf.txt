Tirzepatide reduces fat, calorie intake, and appetite in people with type 2 diabetes

Adults with type 2 diabetes
were randomized across

three groups and
monitored for 28 weeks

Tirzepatide led to significant improvements over semaglutide and placebo on body
weight and fat mass.

Tirzepatide and semaglutide similarly reduced fasting appetite and energy intake
during ad libitum lunch.

More work is needed to understand the mechanistic differences between tirzepatide and semaglutide
in promoting weight loss, reduced calorie intake, and reduced appetite. VAS, visual analog score.

ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS

• The effects of once weekly glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) re-
ceptor agonist tirzepatide were assessed on body weight and composition, appetite, and energy intake in a
phase 1 randomized, placebo-controlled study.

• At 28 weeks, tirzepatide (15 mg) demonstrated significant body weight reduction compared with selective GLP-1
receptor agonist, semaglutide (1 mg), which was mainly due to fat mass reduction.

• Both tirzepatide and semaglutide significantly reduced fasting appetite and ad libitum energy intake during lunch.
• These data highlight greater effects of tirzepatide than semaglutide on total body mass and fat mass reduction in

people with type 2 diabetes.

OBJECTIVE

To evaluate the effects of tirzepatide on body composition, appetite, and energy
intake to address the potential mechanisms involved in body weight loss with
tirzepatide.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

In a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, parallel-arm study, the
effects of tirzepatide 15 mg (N = 45), semaglutide 1 mg (N = 44), and placebo
(N = 28) on body weight and composition, appetite, and energy intake were as-
sessed at baseline and week 28.

RESULTS

Tirzepatide treatment demonstrated significant reductions in body weight com-
pared with placebo and semaglutide, resulting in greater fat mass reduction. Tir-
zepatide and semaglutide significantly reduced appetite versus placebo. Appetite
scores and energy intake reductions did not differ between tirzepatide and
semaglutide.

CONCLUSIONS

Differences in energy intake during ad libitum lunch were not sufficient to explain
the different weight outcomes. Further evaluation is needed to assess mechanis-
tic differences related to tirzepatide actions on 24-h energy intake, substrate utili-
zation, and energy expenditure.

Tirzepatide, a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like
peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, is approved for the treatment of type 2 diabe-
tes (T2D). Tirzepatide causes robust body weight loss mainly by reduction in energy
intake and by increasing energy expenditure in preclinical models (1) and has dem-
onstrated robust body weight reductions in people with T2D (2). We hypothesized
that body weight loss with tirzepatide is mainly driven by reduced energy intake.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Study Design and Participants
Measurements of body composition, appetite, and energy intake were performed
as secondary assessments in a mechanism of action study, with main objectives
and safety results published (3). Eligible patients were randomized (3:3:2) to re-
ceive once weekly 15 mg tirzepatide (N 5 45), 1 mg semaglutide (N 5 44), or pla-
cebo (N 5 28) (Supplementary Material).

Procedures
Body weight was measured every 4 weeks,
and body composition (BOD PODmeasure-
ment system; COSMED, Rome, Italy) was
assessed at baseline and week 28. Fasting
visual analog scale (VAS) ratings of hunger,
satiety, fullness, and prospective food con-
sumption were completed, and a compos-
ite of the four scores was used to calculate
an overall appetite score (4–6). Energy in-
take was determined by measuring ad
libitum food intake during a 45-minute
buffet-style lunch performed at baseline
and weeks 8, 16, and 28 (Supplementary
Material).

Objectives
Energy metabolism objectives assessed
the effects of tirzepatide versus placebo
and semaglutide on body weight, body
composition, fasting appetite, and en-
ergy intake during ad libitum lunch.

Statistical Analysis
Analyses were conducted on data from
all randomized patients who received at
least one dose of the study drug and
had evaluable pharmacodynamic data
(pharmacodynamic analysis set). Analysis
of variance was conducted for baseline
comparisons across groups. Analysis of co-
variance was conducted for fat mass and
fat-free mass with study treatment as a
fixed effect and baseline measurement as
a covariate. Mixed-model repeated meas-
ures were conducted for bodyweight, fast-
ing overall appetite, the four individual
VAS appetite scores, and energy intake us-
ing a restrictedmaximum likelihood–based
approach for parameter estimation. Analy-
ses included fixed effects of study treat-
ment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction,
and baselinemeasurement as a covariate.
Significance tests were conducted at

a5 0.05 (two-sided). Estimated treatment
differenceswere presented as least squares
mean and 95% CIs in brackets.We did not
imputefor missing data and multiplicity ad-
justment in this exploratory analysis. Statis-
tical analyses were done using SAS version
9.4, unless otherwise specified. Additional
details are in SupplementaryMaterial.

RESULTS

Baseline demographics and clinical charac-
teristics were balanced, except for longer
T2D duration andmore older patients ran-
domly assigned to semaglutide (Table 1).
Safety outcomes were published (3); the
overall pattern of adverse events was con-
sistent with incretin class molecules and
comparable between treatment groups.

Body Weight Assessment
Body weight significantly reduced from
baseline with tirzepatide and semaglu-
tide (P < 0.001, all time points) (Fig. 1A).
Treatment differences were observed as
early as week 5 with tirzepatide (�2.6 kg)
versus placebo (�1.0 kg; estimated treat-
ment differences [95% CI]: �1.5 kg [�2.3,
�0.8]; P < 0.001) and semaglutide
(�1.9 kg; �0.7 kg [�1.4, �0.1]; P 5
0.029), and continued throughout the
trial. At week 28, tirzepatide-treated patients
achieved �11 kg of weight reduction, vs.
0 kg with placebo (�11.2 kg [�14.0,�8.4];
P < 0.001) and ��7 kg with semaglutide
(�4.3 kg [�6.8,�1.9];P< 0.001) (Fig. 1B).

Body Composition Assessment
At week 28, fat mass and fat-free mass
significantly reduced from baseline with
tirzepatide and semaglutide, but not
with placebo (Fig. 1C and D). Fat mass
reductions differed in tirzepatide versus
placebo (�9.6 kg [�12.4, �6.9]; P <
0.001) and semaglutide (�3.8 kg [�6.2,
�1.4]; P 5 0.002). Similarly, percentage
of fat mass loss was greater with tir-
zepatide (�7.1%) versus semaglutide
(�4.0%) (�3.1% [�4.9, �1.2]; P 5
0.001) (Fig. 1C). Fat-free mass reduc-
tions differed in tirzepatide versus pla-
cebo (�1.5 kg [�2.3, �0.7]; P < 0.001)

and semaglutide (�0.8 kg [�1.5, �0.1];
P 5 0.018) (Fig. 1D). Body weight loss
with tirzepatide was predominantly driven
by fat mass reduction (Fig. 1B, D, E).

Fasting Appetite
At week 28, appetite reduced from base-
line, as reflected by higher overall appetite
scores, with tirzepatide and semaglutide
(P < 0.001) but not placebo (P 5 0.241)
(Fig. 2A). This effect differed in tirzepatide
versus placebo (15.0 [4.1, 25.9]; P 5
0.007) but not versus semaglutide (5.3
[�4.0, 14.6]; P 5 0.260). Longitudinal in-
creases in component VAS scores for sati-
ety and fullness and decreases in scores
for hunger and prospective food consump-
tion were observed with tirzepatide and
semaglutide (Fig. 2B–E).

Energy Intake During Ad Libitum
Buffet-Style Lunch
Baseline energy intake was similar be-
tween groups. At week 8, energy intake
significantly reduced from baseline in all
groups (Fig. 3A). Reductions were greater
with tirzepatide versus placebo (�185.3 kcal
[�312.7, �57.8]; P 5 0.005), semaglutide
versus placebo (�130.2 kcal [�257.4,�3.0];
P 5 0.045), and were numerically, but not
significantly, higher with tirzepatide versus
semaglutide (�55.1 kcal [�165.0, 54.9];
P 5 0.323). At week 16, all groups con-
sumed significantly fewer calories com-
pared with baseline (Fig. 3A). Compared
with placebo, reductions from baseline
in energy intake were greater with sema-
glutide (�143.4 kcal [�282.4,�4.4]; P5
0.043) and trended toward greater re-
ductions with tirzepatide (�129.9 kcal
[�269.5, 9.7]; P 5 0.068). At week 28,
energy intake significantly reduced from
baseline with tirzepatide and semaglu-
tide, but not with placebo. These reduc-
tions were greater with tirzepatide versus
placebo (�309.8 kcal [�423.0, �196.6];
P < 0.001) and were numerically, but not
significantly, greaterwith tirzepatide versus
semaglutide (�64.3 kcal [�160.3, 31.7];
P5 0.187) (Fig. 3B).

CONCLUSIONS

Tirzepatide achieved significant weight re-
duction versus placebo in people with T2D.
Body composition analyses demonstrated
that the body weight loss was mainly due
to fat mass reduction. Semaglutide pro-
duced substantial, albeit smaller, weight
reduction that was also predominantly

explained by fat mass loss. Tirzepatide and
semaglutide significantly reduced fasting
appetite and energy intake during ad libi-
tum lunch. Assessing the effect of tirzepa-
tide on 24-h energy intake and energy
expenditure using respiratory chambers is
ongoing (clinical trial no. NCT04081337).

Tirzepatide and semaglutide decreased
weight primarily through a reduction in fat
mass. Nevertheless, the absolute changes
in total and fat mass were greater with tir-
zepatide, suggesting that the added effi-
cacy of tirzepatide may be achieved by
utilizing body fat more effectively than
semaglutide. The underlying mechanisms
of this effect are unclear, and not ex-
plained by changes in energy intake during
lunch. Actions of tirzepatide to modulate
adipose lipid storage through actions at
GIP receptors have been described in pre-
clinical and clinical studies (7) and may
contribute to such differential actions of
tirzepatide.

In a 12-week crossover trial, 1 mg
semaglutide significantly reduced total
energy intake across all ad libitum meals
by �24% versus placebo (8). The effect
was primarily observed during ad libitum

lunch (35% reduction with semaglutide
versus placebo) (8). Therefore, we fo-
cused on ad libitum lunch energy intake
assessment and observed similar reduc-
tions in energy intake for the two active
treatments versus placebo. At week 28, a
numerically, but not significantly, greater
reduction in energy intake during ad libi-
tum lunch was observed with tirzepatide
versus semaglutide (�64 kcal difference).
Such a difference during ad libitum lunch
may contribute to the differences inweight
reduction between tirzepatide and sema-
glutide, particularly if considering total
daily energy intake. Hence, up to week
16, reductions in energy intake during
lunch were similar for tirzepatide and
semaglutide, whereas weight reductions
started to separate as early as week 5.
Therefore, the differences in total energy
intake, in addition to other mechanisms,
may contribute to the differences in body
weight loss observed with tirzepatide ver-
sus semaglutide (8).

Study limitations include limited study
population diversity, thus limiting general-
izability, andmodest differences in baseline
characteristics between groups. Although

these analyses were prespecified and hy-
pothesis driven, the study sample size was
not explicitly powered for these second-
ary and exploratory outcomes. The evalu-
ation of energy intake was guided by
lunch-specific treatment effects observed
with semaglutide (8), which reflected a
single meal. However, this focused mea-
surement of energy intake may not fully
reflect the treatment differences on total
energy intake. Animal data suggest that
food intake reduction is more prolonged
with tirzepatide compared with selective
GLP-1 receptor agonist (1), and maybe a
separation of energy intakemayoccur later.
The energy intake measures may have
been influenced by the artificial setting of
the research clinic, the specific food choices
provided in the buffet, and the assessment
being limited to only lunch. Overall, these
observations emphasize the value of in-
cluding a placebo group, particularly where
the background treatment includes a
study-wide dietary intervention to ex-
plain treatment effect. The measurement
of appetite VAS under fasting conditions
prevented observations of treatment
group differences inmeal-related appetite

Figure 2—Fasting overall VAS score and individual components over time. Data are LSM ± SE of ANOVA on baseline (actual values) and MMRM
postbaseline values over time from the pharmacodynamic analysis set. (A) Fasting overall appetite score over time. Note: A higher overall score in-
dicated less appetite. (B) Fasting satiety score over time. Note: A higher overall score indicated less satiety. (C) Fasting fullness score over time.
Note: A higher overall score indicated less fullness. (D) Fasting hunger score over time. (E) Fasting prospective food consumption score over time.
*P < 0.05 and **P < 0.001 tirzepatide versus placebo; †P < 0.05 semaglutide versus placebo. LSM, least squares mean; MMRM, mixed-model
repeated measures.

effects. While fat-free mass was calcu-
lated from body weight and fat mass
rather than directly measured, previous
studies showed a high reliability of
these data compared with direct meas-
urements (9).
These data highlight greater effects of

tirzepatide than semaglutide on total body
mass and fat mass reduction in people
with T2D. As the effects of tirzepatide and
semaglutide on appetite and energy intake
were similar, we posit that additionalmech-
anisms contributed to an energy balance
that underlies the greater weight reduction
benefit of tirzepatide. Whether and how
the difference inweight reduction between
tirzepatide and semaglutide is related to
GIP receptor agonism by tirzepatide needs
to be elucidated in future studies.
