Abstract

Recent studies suggested an association between atrial myopathy and stroke independent of 

atrial fibrillation (AF). We examined the hypothesis that atrial myopathy may be associated with 

ischemic stroke in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). This is 

an exploratory, post-hoc analysis of the TOPCAT trial. Patients with sinus rhythm documented 

at baseline ECG and without known AF were included in this analysis. Atrial myopathy was 

defined by echocardiographic evidence of left atrial enlargement (left atrial diameter > 46mm 

or left atrial volume index > 36 mL/m2) or elevated natriuretic peptides (BNP > 100 pg/mL or 

NT-Pro-BNP > 400 pg/mL). We used Cox regression to investigate the effect of atrial myopathy 

on incident ischemic stroke over the study period. Among 3445 patients in the TOPCAT trial, 

2225 (mean age 67.5±4.9 years; female 54.8%) had normal sinus rhythm at baseline and no 

history of AF. Atrial myopathy was present in 756 (34.0%) patients. During a median follow-up 

of 2 years, 56 (2.5%) patients developed ischemic stroke, including 25 with atrial myopathy. Atrial 

myopathy was associated with increased risk of stroke (HR=1.74, 95% CI 1.01 – 2.98, p=0.04) 

in multivariate analysis. Diabetes (HR=2.02, 95% CI 1.19 – 3.43 p=0.01) was the only other 

independent predictor of stroke. Among patients with HFpEF, atrial myopathy increases the risk of 

ischemic stroke, in the absence of AF. Further investigations are needed to better characterize this 

association and implement stroke prevention strategies.

fibrillation (AF) and HFpEF are closely associated, and progressive left atrial (LA) 

remodeling has been demonstrated to correlate with increasing AF burden in patients 

with HFpEF2. However, it has been shown that atrial structural and electrical changes, 

collectively referred to as atrial myopathy, occur even in the absence of AF3.4. While AF 

increases stroke risk by 5-fold, the lack of temporal association between AF and stroke 

events has led to the description of a new paradigm, where AF would be considered 

a marker of atrial myopathy rather than the cause of stroke4–6. At present however, 

there are no standard diagnostic criteria for atrial myopathy, even though biochemical, 

electrocardiographic, and echocardiographic markers have been used to screen for atrial 

myopathy in selected populations, including those with embolic stroke of unknown 

significance (ESUS)6. Recent studies demonstrated a correlation of markers of atrial 

myopathy with stroke events7,8. Importantly, LA enlargement and pro–B-type natriuretic 

peptide (NT-proBNP) were found to predict ischemic stroke in patients without known 

AF7,8. In light of the strong association of HFpEF with atrial myopathy3, we conducted 

a post hoc analysis of the TOPCAT trial, to investigate the predisposing role of atrial 

myopathy in developing ischemic stroke in a subpopulation of patients with HFpEF without 

known AF.

Methods

The study design, inclusion criteria, and primary findings of TOPCAT have been previously 

described9. The data and study materials were made available through the National Institutes 

of Health. TOPCAT was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial 

that evaluated the effects of spironolactone in patients with symptomatic HFpEF. Briefly, 

the trial included patients older than 50 years with signs and symptoms of heart failure, 

left ventricular ejection fraction >45%, controlled systolic blood pressure, serum potassium 

levels <5 mmol/L, serum creatinine <2.5 mg/dL, and who fulfilled at least 1 of the following 

inclusion criteria: (1) history of hospitalization for HF within the past 12 months; or (2) 

brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) ≥100 pg/mL or an N-terminal-pro-BNP (NT-pro-BNP) ≥360 

pg/mL within 60 days before randomization. The study included 3445 participants from 

233 sites across the Americas and Europe. The mean duration of follow-up was 3.4 ± 1.7 

years. The primary end point was time to first of cardiovascular death, HF hospitalization, 

or aborted cardiac arrest. All end-points after randomization were adjudicated by a central 

adjudication committee blinded to treatment assignment. The Institutional Review Board at 

the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center approved the present analysis.

For this analysis, the primary end point was incident ischemic stroke over the study period. 

Among 3445 patients in the TOPCAT trial, we included 2225 patients with sinus rhythm 

documented at baseline ECG and not known to have a history of AF. Patients were screened 

for atrial myopathy with available echocardiographic and/ or laboratory data at baseline, 

defined as left atrial enlargement (left atrial diameter > 46mm or left atrial volume index 

> 36 mL/m2) or elevated natriuretic peptides (BNP > 100 pg/mL or NT-Pro-BNP > 400 

pg/mL)10. Using this definition, atrial myopathy was present in 756 (34.0%) patients. 

Echocardiographic variables were available for 575 (25.8%) patients and 840 (37.8 %) 

patients had baseline natriuretic peptide values available for this analysis.

Baseline characteristics including age, race, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, 

hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 

(COPD), thyroid disease, peripheral artery disease, history of stroke, pacemaker, and 

smoking were compared using the chi-square test and Student’s t-test test for categorical 

and continuous variables, respectively. Stroke-free survival was calculated using the Kaplan-

Meier method. Patients were censored if they were lost to follow up or died during the 

follow up period before a stroke event occurred. Subgroups were compared using the 

log-rank method. Associations between atrial myopathy, other variables and endpoints 

were determined using Cox proportional hazards models. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% 

confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Variables that were significant by univariate 

analysis were entered into a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model with backwards 

elimination to identify the most parsimonious model. Interaction between atrial myopathy 

and other clinical variables were also considered, and were dropped from the model when 

not statistically significant. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant for main 

and interaction effects. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, 

NC).

Results

A total of 2225 patients with HFpEF without known history of AF at baseline were 

included in this analysis. The mean age was 67.5± 4.9 years, and 54.8% were female. Atrial 

myopathy was present in 756 (34.0%) patients. Of those, 58 had left atrial enlargement, 

622 had elevated BNP and 74 had both. Over a median follow-up of 2 years, 56 (2.5%) 

patients developed ischemic strokes, including 25 with atrial myopathy. During the follow 

up period, 96 (4.3%) patients developed AF [49 (6.5%) and 47 (3.2%) with and without 

atrial myopathy, respectively; p=0.0004]. Three (3.1%) of these patients who developed AF 

during follow up, also developed stroke, including 2 patients with atrial myopathy. The 

baseline characteristics of patients with and without atrial myopathy are summarized in 

Table 1. Patients with atrial myopathy had more comorbidities, including diabetes (42.6%), 

dyslipidemia (70.4%), peripheral arterial disease (13.3%), history of pacemaker implantation 

(7.9%) and history of prior strokes (8.9%) compared to those without atrial myopathy. More 

patients with atrial myopathy were on aspirin and warfarin, compared to those without atrial 

myopathy (31.5% vs. 18.7%; p<0.001 and 4.8% vs. 1.3%; p<0.001, respectively), likely 

reflecting the higher burden of comorbidities. In addition, atrial myopathy patients had 

larger left atria and higher left ventricular filling pressures, as estimated by the ratio of the 

mitral inflow velocity to the mitral annular velocity (E/e’).

Incident stroke during follow up occurred in 25 (3.3%) patients with atrial myopathy and 31 

(2.1%) patients without atrial myopathy (HR=1.94, 95% CI 1.14 – 3.31, p=0.01, Figure 1). 

By univariate analysis, other variables associated with incident stroke included diabetes 

(p=0.003), dyslipidemia (p=0.04) and aspirin use (p=0.001); Table 2). By multivariate 

analysis, the only independent predictors of incident stroke were atrial myopathy (HR=1.74, 

95% CI 1.01 – 2.98, p=0.04) and diabetes (HR=2.02, 95% CI 1.19 – 3.44, p=0.01; Table 2). 

There was no interaction of atrial myopathy with age or diabetes.

Furthermore, since the definition of atrial myopathy is still not well defined4–6, we 

performed a sensitivity analysis by defining atrial myopathy using echocardiographic 

parameters only (LA diameter >4.6cm and/or LA volume index >36ml/m2). Using this 

definition, atrial myopathy was still associated with incident stroke (HR=2.43, 95% CI 1.02 

– 5.99, p=0.03, Figure 2). We further divided the LA diameter into tertiles and assessed the 

association of incident stroke by tertiles. Compared with those in the lowest tertile, those in 

the highest tertile had a nearly 5-fold increase in the risk of incident stroke (HR=4.82, 95% 

CI 1.04 – 22.35, p=0.04), whereas there was a numerical, albeit non-significant increase in 

the risk of stroke in those in the middle tertile (HR=2.39, 95% CI 0.51–11.23, p=0.27).

Discussion

The current secondary analysis of the TOPCAT trial assessed the hypothesis that atrial 

myopathy would increase the risk of incident stroke in patients with HFpEF independent 

of the presence of AF. Our results, which support this hypothesis, are consistent with 

recent evidence linking impaired left atrial function in HFpEF with adverse outcomes11. 

Importantly, our results highlight the notion that structural and cellular changes in the 

left atrium may be the final common pathway of multiple comorbidities, including AF, 

predisposing to thrombogenesis, and eventually leading to thromboembolic stroke6. This 

notion is being prospectively tested in the ARCADIA trial (Atrial Cardiopathy and 

Antithrombotic Drugs in Prevention After Cryptogenic Stroke), in which patients with 

ESUS and either left atrial enlargement, abnormally high P-wave terminal force in ECG lead 

V1, or elevated N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide are randomly assigned to either 

apixaban or aspirin for secondary stroke prevention12. It should be noted that a universal 

definition of atrial myopathy is lacking at present6,10. In our analysis, we used acceptable 

markers for atrial myopathy, including LA dilation and elevated natriuretic peptides, based 

on evidence from previous studies showing that these values are associated with elevated 

thromboembolic risk6,10.

The “atrial myopathy” concept reframes our understanding of the relationship between 

AF and thromboembolism. Atrial myopathy refers to adverse atrial structural, electrical, 

and functional abnormalities that can present irrespective of AF, but may lead to AF4–6. 

Importantly, although AF may lead to the initiation and/or progression of atrial myopathy, 

the presence of AF is not essential to the development and/or maintenance of the atrial 

myopathic state6. Atrial myopathy is caused by comorbid conditions, including aging, 

obesity, inflammation, oxidative stress, and stretching of the atria, which are prevalent in 

patients with HFpEF3. At the cellular level, atrial myopathy is associated with alterations in 

calcium cycling, ion channels, and gap junctions, as well as structural changes, manifesting 

as fibrosis6. These changes, coupled with endothelial dysfunction and stasis, induce a 

prothrombotic state, leading to thrombogenesis, independent of AF6. Clinical studies 

corroborate these experimental findings. The ASSERT trial, that enrolled 2,580 patients 

with cardiac implantable electronic devices demonstrated a lack of temporal association 

between AF episodes and ischemic stroke, with only 8% of patients having AF episodes 

within 30 days of stroke events13. In addition, rhythm control trials such as RACE 

(Rate Control versus Electrical Cardioversion for Persistent Atrial Fibrillation Study) and 

AFFIRM (Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management) failed to

demonstrate improvement in stroke prevention by maintaining sinus rhythm, suggesting 

that local stasis during AF is not the primary cause of stroke14,15. Our results support this 

concept and highlight the role of atrial myopathy and diabetes in the development of stroke 

in patients with HFpEF. Taking this concept a step forward, it has been proposed that cardiac 

inflammation, fibrosis and microvascular dysfunction represent the final common pathway 

leading to both HFpEF and thromboembolism through atrial and ventricular myopathy, 

while AF is a marker of atrial myopathy, rather than the cause of thromboembolism3. 

Further studies are required to elucidate the complex association between HFpEF, atrial 

myopathy and thromboembolism.

A major hurdle in our understanding of the association of atrial myopathy with 

thromboembolism is that a clear definition of atrial myopathy is not currently available. 

Methods to identify atrial myopathy include atrial electrograms showing fractionation, 

indicative of fibrosis, tissue biopsy showing fibrosis, cardiac imaging, including 

echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and serum biomarkers5. 

Development of molecular imaging probes for detection of atrial myopathy might enable 

early diagnosis, ultimately leading to improved treatment outcomes16. Meanwhile, the 

most commonly diagnostic criteria of atrial myopathy include LA size, N-terminal pro–

B-type natriuretic peptide levels (NT-proBNP), and P-wave terminal force in V16,10. These 

parameters are being used to define atrial myopathy in the ongoing ARCADIA trial12. In our 

study, we used LA enlargement and elevated natriuretic peptides to define atrial myopathy. 

Notably, a systematic review including 67,875 patients underlined the predisposing role of 

LA enlargement for stroke development in patients with sinus rhythm17. Moreover, a post 

hoc analysis of the NAVIGATE ESUS, which failed to show a superiority of rivaroxaban 

compared to aspirin in secondary stroke prevention in the overall study population with 

ESUS, demonstrated that patients with enlarged left atrium (estimated as left atrial diameter 

>4.6 cm, ≈10% of trial patients) had a significant reduction of recurrent strokes with 

rivaroxaban than aspirin18. A recent prospective cohort study emphasized the association 

between high NT-proBNP levels and increased risk of cardioembolic stroke in the general 

population19. Another post-hoc analysis of the WARSS trial suggested a significant decrease 

in secondary stroke risk in patients with elevated NT-proBNP (>750 pg/ml), who were 

treated with warfarin rather than aspirin20. Our results are in line with the findings of 

these two secondary analyses; however, this evidence should be regarded as hypothesis-

generating and will require confirmation in a prospective trial. It also remains unclear 

whether initiation of oral anticoagulation therapy in patients with markers of atrial myopathy 

or with cryptogenic stroke or ESUS will decrease recurrent stroke events.

There are several limitations of this analysis. This is a post-hoc exploratory analysis that 

stratified patients according to the presence or absence of atrial myopathy and should thus 

be regarded as hypothesis-generating only. Our findings may not be generalizable to the 

general population since we included a specific population with HFpEF. Echocardiographic 

data were available in a fraction of the total population, therefore, we elected to include 

elevated natriuretic peptide values in the definition of atrial myopathy, acknowledging that 

some patients may have such elevation due to heart failure rather than atrial myopathy. 

However, in our sensitivity analysis including patients with atrial myopathy according 

to echocardiographic left atrial dilation, corroborated our initial findings. These issues

highlight the need for a more accurate biomarker indicative of atrial myopathy, which is 

lacking at present. AF may be underdiagnosed due to its intermittent nature; therefore, the 

risk for misclassification bias cannot be excluded. Finally, due to a probable incomplete 

ischemic stroke workup during the TOPCAT trial, it is possible that some patients with 

new-onset stroke in this study did not have ESUS, but a different etiology for stroke.

Atrial myopathy in patients with HFpEF patients without AF is associated with a high risk 

of stroke. Further studies are warranted to confirm these findings and evaluate whether early 

identification of atrial myopathy based on novel biomarkers may identify a subpopulation at 

higher risk of stroke who might benefit from oral anticoagulation therapy.
